1	JAKE TAPPER, CNN	Live from The George Washington University in the nation's capital, this is CNN's debate night on the future of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.	0
2	JAKE TAPPER, CNN	Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world.	0
3	JAKE TAPPER, CNN	I'm Jake Tapper.	0
4	DANA BASH, CNN	And I'm Dana Bash.	0
5	DANA BASH, CNN	President Trump has made the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act one of his top priorities.	0
6	DANA BASH, CNN	To certain members of our audience, that legislation has been a life-saver.	0
7	DANA BASH, CNN	To others, it has harmed livelihoods.	0
8	DANA BASH, CNN	These defenders and supporters of Obamacare will get to question two leading members of Congress who will shape what comes next.	0
9	TAPPER	So, please welcome the runners-up for the Democratic and Republican nominations for president, in their first debate, Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont...	0
10	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
11	TAPPER	... and Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas.	0
12	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
13	BASH	Senators, welcome.	0
14	BASH	Please take your positions behind the podiums.	0
15	BASH	Now, before your opening statements, I want to talk about the ground rules that you both agreed to.	0
16	BASH	You will get 90 seconds to answer questions posed to you, 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals.	0
17	BASH	Timing lights will guide you.	0
18	BASH	As we mentioned, a handful of members of our audience, which include both critics and defenders of the Affordable Care Act, will question you, in addition to questions from Jake and myself.	0
19	BASH	As moderators, we will guide the debate.	0
20	BASH	And we will begin with two-minute opening statements on what should happen to health care in America.	0
21	BASH	Senator Sanders?	0
22	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	Let me begin by thanking CNN for sponsoring this debate and let me thank all of those who are watching.	0
23	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	Let me get right to the point.	0
24	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	Senator Cruz, like most Republicans, has said that he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, or so-called Obamacare.	0
25	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	Let me tell you what that will mean to the American people.	0
26	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	It means that if you are one of 20 million Americans who finally has received health insurance, forget about it, you're gone.	0
27	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	You're off health insurance.	0
28	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	And that means when you get sick, you ain't going to be able to go to the doctor.	0
29	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	And when you end up in the hospital, you'll be paying those bills for the rest of your life, or maybe you'll go bankrupt.	0
30	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	What the repeal of the ACA means, that if you are one of 10 million senior citizens who today is struggling with the outrageous cost of prescription drugs, your prescription drug costs are going to go up on average about $2,000.	0
31	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	What the repeal of the ACA means is that if you are suffering with cancer, with diabetes, with serious mental illness, you will be put into a position where you may be rejected from any insurance at all, because you have a pre-existing condition.	0
32	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	And by the way, women are considered a pre-existing condition by the insurance companies because they might have a baby.	1
33	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	Is the ACA perfect?	0
34	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	No.	0
35	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	Nobody believes that it is.	0
36	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	And nobody believes that we do not need to improve it.	0
37	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	But the debate is whether we kill it entirely or we make improvements in it.	0
38	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	And I will tell you:  Overwhelming majority of the American people say do not simply repeal the ACA.	0
39	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	Make improvements.	0
40	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	Last point.	0
41	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	The United States is the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a right.	1
42	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	I believe we should move in that direction.	0
43	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	The ACA has been a step forward.	0
44	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	We have got to go further and join every other major country on Earth and say that if you are an American, you are guaranteed health care as a right, not a privilege.	0
45	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT	Thank you.	0
46	BASH	Thank you, Senator Sanders.	0
47	BASH	Senator Cruz, what should happen with health care in America?	0
48	SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX	Well, Dana, I think I get an opening statement, as well, so I'll start with that.	0
49	BASH	Please.	0
50	CRUZ	Which is just simply saying thank you.	0
51	CRUZ	Thank you, guys, for hosting this.	0
52	CRUZ	Thank you for Bernie for joining this.	0
53	CRUZ	And thank you to CNN for hosting this.	0
54	CRUZ	You know, often in politics we have debates that are sound bites, that are 60 seconds or 90 seconds on a topic, and I appreciate CNN devoting real time to this issue, because it matters.	0
55	CRUZ	Health care is personal in a way that is different from most other political issues.	0
56	CRUZ	Health care affects our families.	0
57	CRUZ	It's our moms.	0
58	CRUZ	Health care is our kids.	0
59	CRUZ	It's the future.	0
60	CRUZ	It can quite literally be whether we live or die.	0
61	CRUZ	And this is an issue where Bernie Sanders and I have fundamentally different approaches.	0
62	CRUZ	Bernie and the Democrats want government to control health care.	0
63	CRUZ	I trust you.	0
64	CRUZ	And I trust your doctors.	0
65	CRUZ	I think health care works better when you're in charge of your family's health care decisions, when you can sit down with your doctor and decide the care that's best for your family without government setting rules, without government rationing, without wait periods.	0
66	CRUZ	And that's the fundamental divide we're having.	0
67	CRUZ	You know, six years ago, when Obamacare was being adopted, it's possible that reasonable minds could have differed on whether this was a good idea.	0
68	CRUZ	But six years into it, we've seen the results.	0
69	CRUZ	We remember Obamacare, a series of promises were made to us by President Obama.	0
70	CRUZ	Number one, most infamously, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan.	0
71	CRUZ	President Obama said that 37 different times.	0
72	CRUZ	As 6 million people across this country discovered, that was not true when they had their plans canceled against their wishes.	0
73	CRUZ	If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.	0
74	CRUZ	Again, millions discovered that wasn't true.	0
75	CRUZ	And President Obama promised the American people the average family's premiums would drop $2,500.	0
76	CRUZ	Not only wasn't that true, but the average family's premiums have risen $5,000.	0
77	CRUZ	That's why people are unhappy with this disaster of a law, because it's driven up the cost of health care, it's reduced your choice, it's reduced your freedom, and this last election was a referendum on Obamacare, and the American people quite rightly decided this plan isn't working.	0
78	TAPPER	Senator Cruz, thank you so much.	0
79	TAPPER	We have a lot of questions for both of you from members of the audience, but before we get to them, I want to ask about a pressing matter on Capitol Hill, and I'll start with you, Senator Cruz.	0
80	TAPPER	House Speaker Paul Ryan said today that the legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare would be done this year.	0
81	TAPPER	On Sunday, President Trump said that a plan may not be rolled out until 2018.	0
82	TAPPER	Not that it would, but that it may not be rolled out until 2018.	0
83	TAPPER	Is anything less than a full and swift repeal and replacement of Obamacare a broken promise?	0
84	CRUZ	Listen, I think everyone agrees there is an urgency to honor the promises we made.	0
85	CRUZ	You know, since Obamacare was passed, we've had multiple elections, 2010, 2014, 2016, where the number-one issue in each of those elections was Obamacare.	0
86	CRUZ	And, you know, what we're arguing here was argued in front of the American people.	0
87	CRUZ	The Democrats said over and over again, if Obamacare is repealed, all these people are going to lose coverage.	0
88	CRUZ	Now, that's not true, and we're going to get into that.	0
89	CRUZ	But that was the argument that was made to the American people.	0
90	CRUZ	And 2010, 2014, 2016 I believe were a mandate from the voters.	0
91	CRUZ	They said we're tired of premiums going up.	0
92	CRUZ	We're tired of deductibles going up.	0
93	CRUZ	We're tired of losing our doctors of less choices.	0
94	CRUZ	So, yes, should Congress move swiftly to repeal Obamacare?	0
95	CRUZ	Absolutely.	0
96	CRUZ	Now, nobody thinks we're done once Obamacare is repealed.	0
97	CRUZ	Once Obamacare is repealed, we need commonsense reform that increases competition, that empowers patients, that gives you more choices, that puts you in charge of your health care, rather than empowering government bureaucrats to get in the way.	0
98	CRUZ	And these have been commonsense ideas, I would note, that for six years Republicans have been proposing, and for six years Democrats have been fighting, saying no changes at all to Obamacare, even as people were hurting and losing their coverage.	0
99	CRUZ	This election is about honoring the promises we made to the people who elected us.	0
100	TAPPER	Senator Sanders?	0
101	SANDERS	Well, the truth is that the Republicans are now in a panic, because the American people have caught on that the absolute repeal of Obamacare without improvements in it, without a plan to make it better, would be an absolute disaster.	0
102	SANDERS	So when Ted talks about giving people choice, here's your choice.	0
103	SANDERS	You got cancer, and you go to the doctor, and the insurance company says, "We're not going to cover it.	0
104	SANDERS	We can't make money on you because you have cancer.	0
105	SANDERS	You have a pre-existing condition."	0
106	SANDERS	And here's another choice you can have if we get rid of Obamacare.	0
107	SANDERS	If you have diabetes, and you're spending a whole lot on health insurance, the insurance companies will say, sorry, we're only going to spend X dollars, because we've got to make money off you.	0
108	SANDERS	That's the function of private insurance.	0
109	SANDERS	So, do we have to improve the Affordable Care Act?	0
110	SANDERS	Of course we do.	0
111	SANDERS	But let us remember where we came from.	0
112	SANDERS	Before the Affordable Care Act, as Ted probably knows, if you were a family of four during the eight years under George Bush, your premiums doubled.	0
113	SANDERS	So it's not like, oh, gee, just in America today, health care costs are going up.	0
114	SANDERS	They went up much higher before we had the Affordable Care Act.	0
115	TAPPER	Senator Cruz, do you want to respond to that?	0
116	CRUZ	You know, it is interesting to hear so much of the Democratic rhetoric that government controlling your health care is always justified by saying the insurance companies are terrible.	0
117	CRUZ	Now, this is an example of what John Adams famously said, facts are stubborn things.	0
118	CRUZ	Let's talk about some facts.	0
119	CRUZ	In 2008, the 10 largest insurance companies in America made just over $8 billion profit.	0
120	CRUZ	In 2016 -- 2015, rather -- those same 10 largest companies made $15 billion in profit.	0
121	CRUZ	Insurance company profits have doubled under Obamacare.	0
122	CRUZ	That was the result.	0
123	CRUZ	Bernie helped write Obamacare.	1
124	CRUZ	I don't think the federal government ought to be passing a law that doubles insurance company profits and, while those profits were doubling, what happened to the average American family?	0
125	CRUZ	The average American family, your premiums have gone up $5,462.	0
126	CRUZ	At the same time, the average deductible has gone up $5,000.	0
127	CRUZ	For families that are struggling, you're getting less coverage, you're paying more for it, and your deductibles are higher, and you know who's making out like gangbusters?	0
128	CRUZ	The insurance companies and those in government whose solution is let's have even more government control.	0
129	TAPPER	Senator...	0
130	CRUZ	This thing isn't working.	0
131	TAPPER	Senator Sanders?	0
132	SANDERS	You know, I find myself in agreement with Ted.	0
133	SANDERS	He's right.	0
134	SANDERS	The function of insurance companies is not to provide quality health care to all people.	0
135	SANDERS	It's to make as much money as they possibly can.	0
136	SANDERS	Ted, let's work together on a Medicare for all, single-payer program, so we're finally going to get insurance companies, private insurance companies out of our lives.	0
137	SANDERS	As you know, as the American people know, we are the only major country on Earth that allows private insurance companies to run the system.	0
138	SANDERS	But it's not only the points that Ted made about the insurance companies.	0
139	SANDERS	What he forgot to tell you, even adding insult to injury, is many of these CEOs of the insurance companies make outrageous compensation and get all of these severance packages, in some cases over $100 million.	0
140	SANDERS	Ted, let's work together.	0
141	SANDERS	We're going to get those insurance companies out of health care.	0
142	SANDERS	We'll move to a Medicare for all health care program, guaranteeing health care to all people.	0
143	BASH	Thank you, Senators.	0
144	BASH	Unless you want to agree to a single- payer system...	0
145	CRUZ	Look, I would love to respond.	0
146	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
147	SANDERS	You're not going to support that.	0
148	SANDERS	I know that.	0
149	CRUZ	Well, actually, what I will say, Bernie, is I would love for us to work together going after big pharma, and in particular taking on the FDA.	0
150	CRUZ	Right now, it takes $2 billion to approve a new drug.	0
151	CRUZ	Now, I've introduced legislation to reform the FDA process so that new health care -- so that we can be curing diseases and we can be helping people.	0
152	CRUZ	I would encourage you to join me in that legislation.	0
153	SANDERS	I'll tell you what...	0
154	CRUZ	Join me in right to try, so that if someone has a terminal disease, the government won't tell them, you can't try this life- saving medicine because we forbid it.	0
155	TAPPER	Gentlemen, we could do this all night.	0
156	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
157	TAPPER	We're going to get to pharma.	0
158	SANDERS	I'm willing to look at it, if you are willing to look at taking on pharma, which is the greediest of many greedy corporate interests in Washington.	0
159	SANDERS	And I'll tell you what, I'm going to introduce legislation to have Medicare negotiate prices with the pharmaceutical industry.	0
160	SANDERS	I'm going to introduce, again, legislation to allow Americans to buy less expensive medicine in Canada, the U.K., and other countries.	0
161	SANDERS	Let's take on the greed of pharma, substantially lower prescription drug prices.	0
162	CRUZ	And, Dana, let me make a response to this, because this is a good discussion.	0
163	CRUZ	The whole point of having an extended discussion is to say, as you know, with drug re-importation, bringing in drugs from Canada and other countries, just a couple of weeks ago, on the Senate floor, I voted with you...	0
164	SANDERS	You voted for my amendment, that's correct.	0
165	CRUZ	... in support of that, in support of allowing drug re- importation.	0
166	CRUZ	It was the right thing to do.	0
167	CRUZ	But I'll tell you, a much bigger barrier than that is the fact that, you know, in the last 20 years, the FDA has approved only three child cancer drugs?	0
168	CRUZ	In 20 years, because the burdens are so great.	0
169	CRUZ	I introduced legislation that said if a drug is approved in another major country, if it's approved in Europe or Japan or our major respected partners, that the FDA has got 30 days to approve it here.	0
170	CRUZ	We shouldn't be telling people with life-threatening diseases you can't do everything you can to save your lives.	0
171	CRUZ	That would be a great thing.	0
172	BASH	Senator...	0
173	CRUZ	We'd make news if you and I joined up on that.	0
174	SANDERS	We'll need to look at it, but that is not the major problem.	0
175	SANDERS	The major problem with the pharmaceutical industry is, you know what, they could double or triple the prices you pay for medicine tomorrow...	0
176	BASH	Senator Sanders...	0
177	SANDERS	... and there is no legislation to control that.	0
178	BASH	Senator Sanders...	0
179	SANDERS	Hi, Dana, how are you?	0
180	BASH	Oh, hi.	0
181	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
182	SANDERS	Good to see you.	0
183	BASH	So good to see you.	0
184	BASH	We do want to talk more about that later, but I want to get to some of the questions from our audience.	0
185	BASH	One of the most popular parts of Obamacare is -- as you mentioned earlier, requiring insurance companies to cover people with pre-existing conditions.	0
186	BASH	If Obamacare is repealed, 52 million Americans could lose that guaranteed coverage because of their medical histories.	0
187	BASH	One of them is Neosho Ponder, who is fighting breast cancer and currently undergoing radiation treatment.	0
188	BASH	Neosho?	0
189	QUESTION	Senator Cruz, if Obamacare is repealed, is there anything you can do to ensure that provisions are in place so that half of my paycheck won't be spent on health care?	0
190	QUESTION	I didn't ask for cancer.	0
191	QUESTION	I never smoked; I never drank a lot.	0
192	QUESTION	I lived a pretty healthy lifestyle.	0
193	QUESTION	I fear that -- I fear that if I don't have Obamacare, if I'm not covered, then my pre-existing condition of breast cancer and remaining treatments will make it difficult for me to afford insurance.	0
194	QUESTION	Senator Cruz, what can you do to protect people like me who are alive because of Obamacare?	0
195	CRUZ	Well, Neo, thank you for asking that question.	0
196	CRUZ	And how long -- how long have you been diagnosed with breast cancer?	0
197	QUESTION	I was diagnosed on April 25, 2016.	0
198	CRUZ	Wow, well, you're doing great.	0
199	CRUZ	You know, our prayers are with you.	0
200	CRUZ	I'll tell you, my mom had breast cancer, and -- and my mom was diagnosed in 2000.	0
201	CRUZ	I sat by her hospital bed as she went through two surgeries, and it's a horrible disease, but 16 years later, thank God, she is a survivor.	0
202	CRUZ	And I will tell you, our medical innovation has been incredible dealing with breast cancer.	0
203	CRUZ	So all of us -- our prayers and thoughts are with you.	0
204	QUESTION	Thank you.	0
205	CRUZ	You know, you asked about people who get sick and not wanting your insurance canceled, not wanting your premiums to go up, that's absolutely right.	0
206	CRUZ	That is absolutely right.	0
207	CRUZ	And if you look at every proposal that's been submitted, every significant proposal that's been submitted to replace Obamacare, to fix the problems in the health care system after Obamacare is gotten rid of, all of them protect people in your situations.	0
208	CRUZ	All of them prohibit insurance companies from canceling someone because they got sick.	0
209	CRUZ	They prohibit insurance companies from jacking up the insurance rates because they got sick or injured.	0
210	CRUZ	Look, the whole point of insurance is none of us know if we're going to wake up tomorrow, like you did earlier last year, and discover we have a terrible disease.	0
211	CRUZ	And we buy insurance, we pay our premiums, just so we know that we'll be able to take care of that situation.	0
212	CRUZ	So, absolutely, we've got to fix it, and I'm confident that we're going to.	0
213	BASH	Senator Sanders, response?	0
214	SANDERS	Senator, I cannot believe what you just said.	0
215	SANDERS	It's in direct contradiction to everything you ran for president on.	0
216	SANDERS	What Ted has said is, he wants to get rid of all federal mandates.	0
217	SANDERS	Did you say that a hundred times?	0
218	CRUZ	I didn't say it once.	0
219	SANDERS	I will -- said Ted Cruz, I will get rid of every word of Obamacare.	0
220	SANDERS	Excuse me.	0
221	SANDERS	The only way that we are going to make sure that you -- and we all wish you the best -- are able to get the health insurance you need with a pre-existing condition is to make sure that no insurance company in this country can say no to you or to anybody else.	0
222	SANDERS	Now, Ted thinks that's a terrible government intrusion.	0
223	SANDERS	I think it is the moral and right thing to do.	0
224	SANDERS	So, when you hear Ted and other Republicans say we're going to get rid of all of -- we're going to leave it to the states.	0
225	SANDERS	Well, what do you think the states are going to do?	0
226	SANDERS	You think they're going to maintain the ability to protect people with pre-existing conditions?	0
227	SANDERS	They're not.	0
228	SANDERS	We're going to go back to the obscenity of where we were before Obamacare was passed.	0
229	BASH	Senator Cruz, your response.	0
230	BASH	And then could you just clarify, will you support anything that doesn't mandate people with pre- existing conditions continue to have coverage?	0
231	CRUZ	Look, my response is, I said hundreds of times on the campaign trail, yes, we should repeal every word of Obamacare.	0
232	CRUZ	But if you listen to the next sentence, I always said, we're not done yet with health care reform, and we do that.	0
233	CRUZ	We need health care reform.	0
234	CRUZ	And the principles of health care reform, they should expand competition, they should empower patients, and they should keep government from getting between you and your doctor.	0
235	CRUZ	And I talked about all sorts of commonsense ideas to do just that.	0
236	CRUZ	And as I said, a proposal that is consistent in virtually every one of the pieces of Republican legislation that's been filed is a prohibition on insurance companies canceling people because they got sick.	0
237	CRUZ	And, you know, Bernie, it's easy to say to people, gosh, you're going to lose your coverage.	0
238	CRUZ	What do the Democrats say to the 6 million people who had their health insurance canceled?	0
239	CRUZ	What...	0
240	SANDERS	Ted, Ted, you're a good lawyer, and you use words well.	0
241	CRUZ	Thank you.	0
242	SANDERS	What you just said is "cancel your insurance."	0
243	SANDERS	Cancel your insurance, OK?	0
244	SANDERS	That's good.	0
245	SANDERS	But what happens if tomorrow you wake up and you go to the doctor and you discover that you have cancer?	0
246	SANDERS	All right?	0
247	SANDERS	You just discovered it.	0
248	SANDERS	And the insurance companies say, hey, you're not a good deal for us, we can't make money off of you, you will not get that health insurance.	0
249	SANDERS	So I think when people like Ted talk about repealing Obamacare, repealing government mandates -- this is a government mandate, and it is a damn good mandate and a humane mandate.	0
250	BASH	And, Senator Cruz, if you would answer Neosho's specific question.	0
251	CRUZ	Yeah, I did.	0
252	CRUZ	Multiple times, Dana.	0
253	BASH	OK.	0
254	BASH	So you are saying that she will continue to have health care...	0
255	CRUZ	Yeah.	0
256	BASH	... she and others who have pre-existing conditions?	0
257	BASH	And	0
258	BASH	you're going to make sure that that is a mandate and a requirement in whatever legislation you support?	0
259	CRUZ	What I've said is, is virtually all of the Republican legislation that has been filed that the Democrats have opposed maintains a continuity of coverage so that insurance companies can't cancel policies.	0
260	CRUZ	And, you know, the question I asked a minute ago that Bernie chose not to answer is, what do the Democrats say to the 6 million people who had their insurance policies canceled, who got a notification in the mail that you don't get to see your doctors anymore?	0
261	CRUZ	And not just the people who were canceled.	0
262	CRUZ	There are people all over this country who can't afford health insurance because of Obamacare, who the deductibles are so high, the premiums are so high, they say, you know what, my family, we can't make it on this?	0
263	CRUZ	And, you know, you talk about the people covered by Obamacare.	0
264	CRUZ	Here's something most people don't know.	0
265	CRUZ	Most of the people covered by Obamacare are on Medicaid.	1
266	CRUZ	They jammed a bunch more people on Medicaid.	0
267	CRUZ	And I'll tell you what happens.	0
268	CRUZ	People on Medicaid have markedly worse health outcomes than people with private insurance.	0
269	BASH	Senator, we're going to get to these issues...	0
270	CRUZ	I would like to see a lot more people on private insurance, able to be insured for health care...	0
271	BASH	We're going to get to these issues of Medicaid and others....	0
272	CRUZ	... rather than -- but it's relevant to -- he's saying people are going to lose their health care.	0
273	CRUZ	If you want health care, we want as many people as possible to be able to afford insurance policies that protect you when you get sick.	0
274	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
275	SANDERS	I want to just -- very briefly.	0
276	BASH	Go ahead.	0
277	SANDERS	If you listen carefully to what he's saying, if you go to the doctor tomorrow, and you are diagnosed with a terrible illness, the insurance companies do not have to provide you insurance.	0
278	SANDERS	That is what Ted said.	0
279	SANDERS	What he also said, if you have an illness, it has to be kept.	0
280	SANDERS	But really, we are moving into an era where millions of people who develop terrible illnesses will not be able to get insurance.	0
281	SANDERS	And God only knows how many of them will die.	0
282	TAPPER	So, Senator Sanders, you just heard Senator Cruz bring up an issue that a lot of Americans have out there, especially a lot of middle-class Americans, who say that the Affordable Care Act has made it so that their insurance is unaffordable.	0
283	TAPPER	One of them is in our audience right now.	0
284	TAPPER	Her name is Melissa Borkowski.	0
285	TAPPER	She's a nurse practitioner from Florida.	0
286	TAPPER	She is a mother of four.	0
287	TAPPER	She and her husband are paying more than $1,000 a month to insure their family for a plan with a $13,000 deductible.	0
288	TAPPER	Melissa?	0
289	QUESTION	Good evening, Senators.	0
290	QUESTION	Thank you for your time.	0
291	QUESTION	As you said, I'm a nurse practitioner.	0
292	QUESTION	I've worked in health care for over 25 years now.	0
293	QUESTION	But under Obamacare, I'm not able to get the health services I need for myself or my family.	0
294	QUESTION	Last year, I had a very abnormal pap smear and needed additional tests.	0
295	QUESTION	But our plan has a $13,000 deductible before it will cover anything, so I wasn't able to afford to get those tests done.	0
296	QUESTION	So now I sit here wondering if I have an undiagnosed cancer that will eventually take me away from my four children.	0
297	QUESTION	My plan premiums plus deductible cost over $25,000 for the year and it covers little more than basic preventative services.	0
298	QUESTION	Senator Sanders, my question is, why should we, my family, be forced to pay so much money for an insurance plan that is essentially useless and doesn't do anything for me?	0
299	SANDERS	Pam...	0
300	TAPPER	Melissa.	0
301	SANDERS	Melissa, I'm sorry.	0
302	SANDERS	Melissa, you ask a great question, and the answer is, it is totally absurd.	0
303	SANDERS	It is totally absurd.	0
304	SANDERS	But the real question we should be asking -- Melissa is talking about an outrageous deductible, right?	0
305	QUESTION	Yes.	0
306	SANDERS	So it prevents you from going to the doctor when you should be going.	0
307	SANDERS	The real question, which is never talked about or very rarely talked about, is why we end up spending as a nation twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country.	0
308	SANDERS	Now, if you were in Canada, you know what, you would get the health care that you needed.	0
309	SANDERS	If you were in the U.K., France, Germany, Scandinavia, you would get the health care you need as a right of being a citizen in this country.	0
310	SANDERS	The idea that we have policies like that, like the one you describe, is clearly an outrage and should tell every American that we've got to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people as a right.	0
311	SANDERS	And when we do that, by the way, for a vast majority of the American people, their family incomes will go up.	0
312	TAPPER	Senator Cruz?	0
313	CRUZ	You know, Melissa, I'm sorry for the challenges you're facing.	0
314	CRUZ	There are many people in America struggling with exactly what you are, in the wreckage of Obamacare, with skyrocketing premiums, with deductibles that are unaffordable, and with really limited care.	1
315	CRUZ	And I will commend Bernie for his candor.	0
316	CRUZ	I mean, his view all along was that we need government-run and government-controlled health care for everyone.	0
317	CRUZ	And indeed, as he's said here tonight, he thinks other countries do it a lot better than America.	0
318	CRUZ	He often points to Canada, the United Kingdom, he says why do we pay more?	0
319	CRUZ	Well, there's a reason we pay more than those countries.	0
320	CRUZ	We get a lot more and a lot better health care.	0
321	CRUZ	Let me give you some basic facts.	0
322	CRUZ	As I noticed in all the Democratic primary debates, there was no discussion of the facts on the other side.	0
323	CRUZ	The United States, population controlled, delivers three times as many mammograms as Europe, two-and-a-half times the number of MRI scans, and 31 percent more C sections.	0
324	CRUZ	We provide more health care.	0
325	CRUZ	Not only that, in the United Kingdom, for example, wait times, in 2013, you waited 72 days for cataract surgery, you waited 89 days for hip replacement, 95 days for knee replacement.	0
326	CRUZ	There are 3.7 million people in the United Kingdom right now on a waiting list, waiting for health care.	0
327	CRUZ	Whenever you put government in charge of health care, what it means is they ration.	0
328	CRUZ	They decide you get care and you don't.	0
329	CRUZ	I don't think the government has any business telling you you're not entitled to receive health care.	0
330	CRUZ	That's why I think the answer is not more of Obamacare, more government control, more of what got us in this mess.	0
331	CRUZ	Rather, the answer is empower you.	0
332	CRUZ	Give you choices.	0
333	CRUZ	Lower prices.	0
334	CRUZ	Lower premiums.	0
335	CRUZ	Lower deductibles.	0
336	CRUZ	Empower you and put you back in charge of your health care.	0
337	TAPPER	Senator Cruz, thank you.	0
338	TAPPER	Senator Sanders, let me ask you, just as part of Melissa's question, Florida, the state she's from, now offers fewer insurance options through Obamacare through the insurance exchange.	0
339	TAPPER	There was a nearly 25 percent decline in the number of insurers in 2017 nationally compared to 2016.	0
340	TAPPER	There are five states that only have one insurer providing insurance on the exchange.	0
341	TAPPER	What would you do to ensure that consumers have both choice and manageable cost?	0
342	SANDERS	Fair question.	0
343	SANDERS	Let me get back to Melissa, and I'll get to you.	0
344	TAPPER	It's part of the question, because the competition is down.	0
345	SANDERS	I know it is.	0
346	SANDERS	I know it is.	0
347	SANDERS	Well, Ted talks about the problems that exist in other countries in terms of waiting lists.	0
348	SANDERS	He talks about rationing.	0
349	SANDERS	We have enormous rationing in this country.	0
350	SANDERS	When you have 28 million people who have no health insurance, that's rationing.	0
351	SANDERS	When you have people who can't afford to go to the doctor or can't afford to buy prescription drugs, one out of five Americans can't afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe, that's called rationing.	0
352	SANDERS	Except there's no rule on that; there's no law on that.	0
353	SANDERS	It's just people don't have the money to buy what they need in terms of health care.	0
354	SANDERS	To answer your question, Jake, what I have long supported within the context of Obamacare, as we move toward a Medicare for all single payer program, is a public option.	0
355	SANDERS	There should be a Medicare-type public option available in all exchanges, in all states in this country.	0
356	SANDERS	And I think that would substantially lower the cost of health care in this country and provide real competition to the private sector.	0
357	TAPPER	Senator Cruz?	0
358	CRUZ	Well, Jake, I think the question you asked is a very good one.	0
359	CRUZ	And you're right, that choices have gone down dramatically.	0
360	CRUZ	Indeed, I don't know if the cameras can see this, but in 70 percent of the counties in America, on Obamacare exchanges, you have a choice of one or two health insurance plans, that's it, 70 percent of the counties in America.	1
361	CRUZ	It's interesting.	0
362	CRUZ	You look at this map, this also very much looks like the electoral map that elected Donald Trump.	0
363	CRUZ	It's really quite striking that the communities that have been hammered by this disaster of a law said enough already.	0
364	CRUZ	Now, Bernie likes talking about a public option.	0
365	CRUZ	That's another way of saying government control of your health care.	0
366	CRUZ	It's socialized medicine.	0
367	CRUZ	And what does it mean?	0
368	CRUZ	Every country where it's been applied, you've seen rationing, you've seen government deciding, especially seniors.	0
369	CRUZ	Seniors, you don't get the health care you need.	0
370	CRUZ	Now, Bernie mentions Canada quite a bit.	0
371	CRUZ	I know quite a bit about Canadian health care.	0
372	CRUZ	I was born there.	0
373	CRUZ	You know, Bernie, that may be the best argument against your position, you know, look what it produced.	0
374	SANDERS	Look what it...	0
375	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
376	SANDERS	Yeah, that's right.	0
377	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
378	CRUZ	But, you know, people vote with their feet.	0
379	CRUZ	In 2014, over 52,000 Canadians left Canada to get health care in the United States and other countries.	0
380	CRUZ	I'm reminded of a comment Ronald Reagan used to say about East Berlin, about the Berlin Wall.	0
381	CRUZ	He said the funny thing the leftists never seem to notice, the machine guns all point one direction.	0
382	CRUZ	Everyone was fleeing communism and coming to freedom.	0
383	CRUZ	If you look at socialized medicine, people leave there, tens and hundreds of thousands every year, leave socialized medicine countries because they want to get a hip replacement, a knee replacement.	0
384	CRUZ	You know, the governor of one of the Canadian provinces came to America to get heart surgery, and he was a governor in Canada.	0
385	CRUZ	And, by the way, in your home state of Vermont, your hospitals advertise with Canadian flags, "Come to American hospitals, you'll get better health care."	0
386	CRUZ	I don't want to mess up our health care.	0
387	CRUZ	I want patients, all of us to be in charge of our health care, not government deciding what health care we get.	0
388	SANDERS	Government deciding?	0
389	SANDERS	No, government doesn't decide in Canada or anyplace else.	0
390	SANDERS	And, by the way, as you well know, Canada had for many years a conservative prime minister.	0
391	CRUZ	Conservative is relative.	0
392	SANDERS	The United Kingdom had for many, many years a conservative prime minister.	0
393	SANDERS	I don't see those countries junking their health care systems in which, by the way, poll after poll shows not that though don't have problems.	0
394	SANDERS	Of course they have problems.	0
395	SANDERS	Every health care system in the world has problems.	0
396	SANDERS	But I am not seeing those countries junking their universal health care system, which provide health care to all of their people at one half the cost per capita that we do.	0
397	SANDERS	I don't see conservative prime ministers doing that to go to the American health care system.	0
398	SANDERS	Our system is wasteful, it is dysfunctional, it is incredibly bureaucratic.	0
399	SANDERS	You talk about choice?	0
400	SANDERS	You have people who have to argue with insurance companies for days before they can get the care that they need.	0
401	CRUZ	See, Bernie, you say wasteful, and I say people exercising free choice.	0
402	CRUZ	You're right.	0
403	CRUZ	We could cut costs here if we do like Europe and cut the number of MRIs, the number of mammograms.	0
404	CRUZ	If we cut -- you know, you look at the elderly in much of Europe.	0
405	CRUZ	The elderly here, when the elderly face life-threatening diseases, they're often treated in the intensive care unit.	0
406	CRUZ	In Europe, they're often put in palliative care, essentially doped up with some drugs, and said, "Well, now is your time to go."	0
407	SANDERS	Oh.	0
408	CRUZ	I don't expect the government to be saying that.	0
409	CRUZ	And let me give -- since you laughed at that, let's actually talk facts, because facts matter.	0
410	CRUZ	So let's talk about, for example, a couple of stories from the United Kingdom.	0
411	CRUZ	In Glasgow, Scotland, the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital was so overburdened this past January, it turned away three women who were in labor because they couldn't take care of them.	0
412	CRUZ	In Worchester, England, a man was left on an ambulance gurney for five hours before his heart attack was diagnosed, and he waited seven hours before he received a stent and angioplasty.	0
413	CRUZ	In a hospital in Essex, doctors twice canceled a life-saving -- potential life-saving surgery for a patient with esophageal cancer, because there were no free beds in the intensive care unit.	0
414	CRUZ	One more example.	0
415	CRUZ	In Wales, an 82-year-old woman who had fallen waited eight hours on the floor before an ambulance arrived.	0
416	CRUZ	Her daughter sat beside her in the ordeal, described it as one of the longest nights of our life.	0
417	CRUZ	This is what happened when government takes over health care -- every example on Earth -- the result is rationing and waiting periods, and you, the citizens, being told, no, you can't have the health care you want and deserve.	0
418	SANDERS	And in America, we do rationing in a different way, Ted.	0
419	SANDERS	The way we do rationing is, if you are very rich, you can get the best health care in the world, I believe, right here in the United States.	0
420	SANDERS	We should be proud of that.	0
421	SANDERS	But if you are working class, you are going to be having a very difficult time affording the outrageous cost of health care.	0
422	SANDERS	That's what Melissa just told us a moment ago.	0
423	SANDERS	Now, estimates differ, but let's be clear about this.	0
424	SANDERS	Every single year, tens of thousands of our fellow Americans die because they don't go to the doctor when they should.	0
425	SANDERS	You gave some examples about the U.K. Let me give you some examples here in the United States.	0
426	SANDERS	I talk to doctors in Vermont, all over this country, and what they tell me, patients come into their offices very, very sick.	0
427	SANDERS	And they say to the patients, why didn't you come in here a year ago when you felt your tumor, when you felt your problem, when were you sick?	0
428	SANDERS	Why didn't you come in here?	0
429	SANDERS	And people said, "I didn't have any insurance."	0
430	SANDERS	Or, "My deductible was so high, I couldn't go."	0
431	SANDERS	We just heard that story a moment ago.	0
432	SANDERS	And some of those people die.	0
433	SANDERS	And others end up in the hospital at outrageous costs for illnesses that could have been treated initially at far less cost.	0
434	SANDERS	So, please, don't tell me about rationing.	0
435	SANDERS	This country has more rationing than any other industrialized country on Earth, except the rationing is done by income.	0
436	SANDERS	And working-class people and poor people today are suffering as a result of that rationing.	0
437	TAPPER	We're going to take a very quick break.	0
438	TAPPER	The debate will continue right after this with Senators Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders.	0
439	TAPPER	Stay with us.	0
440	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
441	BASH	Welcome back to the CNN debate on the future of health care in America, with Senators Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders.	0
442	BASH	Let's now turn to the effects of Obamacare on small businesses, and with us to discuss is LaRonda Hunter, who owns five hair salons in Texas.	0
443	BASH	LaRonda?	0
444	QUESTION	Hello.	0
445	QUESTION	Under the controls of Obamacare, my business has been restricted from expansion.	0
446	QUESTION	I'm from Fort Worth, Texas.	0
447	QUESTION	I own five Fantastic Sams hair salons.	0
448	QUESTION	We employ between 45 and 48 employees.	0
449	QUESTION	My original plan was to open more salons and employ more people.	0
450	QUESTION	However, under Obamacare, I am restricted, because I -- it requires me to furnish health insurance if I employ more than 50 people.	0
451	QUESTION	Unfortunately, the profit margin in my industry is very thin.	0
452	QUESTION	And I'm not a wealthy person, so it's impossible for me to grow my business.	0
453	QUESTION	My question to you, Senator Sanders, is how do I grow my business?	0
454	QUESTION	How do I employ more Americans without either raising the prices to my customers or lowering wages to my employees?	0
455	SANDERS	Ronda?	0
456	QUESTION	LaRonda.	0
457	SANDERS	LaRonda, OK.  You own five salons?	0
458	QUESTION	That's correct.	0
459	SANDERS	And you employ close to 50 people?	0
460	QUESTION	Just under.	0
461	SANDERS	And what kind of health insurance do you provide for them?	0
462	QUESTION	I don't -- none.	0
463	SANDERS	You provide no health insurance to them?	0
464	QUESTION	Correct.	0
465	SANDERS	Let me be -- let me give you an answer you will not be happy with, and that is I think that for businesses that employ 50 people or more, given the nature of our dysfunctional health care system right now, where most people do get their health insurance through the places that they work, I'm sorry, I think that in America today, everybody should have health care.	0
466	SANDERS	And if you have more than 50 people, you know what, I think -- I'm afraid to tell you -- I think you will have to provide health insurance.	0
467	QUESTION	So my question is, how do I do that without raising my prices to my customers or lowering wages to my employees?	0
468	SANDERS	You see, the difficulty is also is -- and I'm not much of an expert on hairdressing in general, and certainly in Fort Worth...	0
469	QUESTION	I'm just one of small businesses.	0
470	SANDERS	I know.	0
471	SANDERS	But my guess is, one of the problems that we have is there may be somebody else in Fort Worth who is providing decent health insurance to their employees, and they are in an unfair competitive situation regarding you.	0
472	SANDERS	You can compete and maybe charge lower prices, get business, while they on the other hand may be providing decent health insurance.	0
473	SANDERS	I don't think that's that...	0
474	QUESTION	I think you'll find in profit margin in my entire industry...	0
475	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
476	SANDERS	I certainly don't know, you know, about hair salons in Fort Worth.	0
477	SANDERS	But I do believe, to be honest with you, that if you have more than 50 people, yes, you should be providing health insurance.	0
478	BASH	Senator Cruz?	0
479	CRUZ	LaRonda, thank you for sharing your story, and it's good to see	0
480	CRUZ	a fellow Texan here.	0
481	CRUZ	And, you know, I've got to say, I've got a very different view than Bernie.	0
482	CRUZ	I think actually what Bernie told you is the same thing President Obama said, it's the same thing Democrats have said, which is that you, the small business, you're apparently a bad actor, because you're not allowed to manufacture money.	0
483	CRUZ	You know, let me introduce you all to two terms that have become really common, 29ers and 49ers.	0
484	CRUZ	29ers are the millions of people across this country that have been forced into part-time work that used to have full-time employment and are now working 29 hours a week because Obamacare kicks in at 30 hours a week.	1
485	CRUZ	And a lot of them are people that are single moms, they're teenagers, they're immigrants, they're people who are struggling.	0
486	CRUZ	And then 49ers, there are millions of small businesses in the exact situation you're in.	0
487	CRUZ	You know, a couple of months ago, I was out in west Texas, was visiting a dairy farmer, driving around the dairy farm.	0
488	CRUZ	I got to say, interesting smells on the dairy farm.	0
489	CRUZ	Kind of reminds me of Washington.	0
490	CRUZ	But the farmer brought up, he said, you know how many employees I have?	0
491	CRUZ	I said, no.	0
492	CRUZ	He said I've got 49.	0
493	CRUZ	He said, do you know why I have 49?	0
494	CRUZ	And I said, yes, I do, because Obamacare kicks in at 50.	0
495	CRUZ	And he said, I could hire 20 or 30 more employees right now, but Obamacare would bankrupt my business, and that's millions of small businesses.	0
496	CRUZ	So we're here at GW.	0
497	CRUZ	Let me speak for a minute to all the young people.	0
498	CRUZ	When you come out of college with way too many student loans, my guess is you'd like to get a job.	0
499	CRUZ	And millions of small businesses being told by the Democrats, tough luck, we don't care if it drives you out of business, that's taking away opportunity and it's hurting in particular the most vulnerable.	0
500	CRUZ	It's one of the most damaging things about Obamacare.	0
501	BASH	Senator Sanders?	0
502	SANDERS	LaRonda, let me ask you a question.	0
503	SANDERS	What happens if one of your employees becomes ill?	0
504	SANDERS	What happens?	0
505	SANDERS	What happens if one of your employees, as happens in every part of the country, gets diabetes, gets cancer?	0
506	SANDERS	What do they do if they don't have any health insurance?	0
507	QUESTION	I can't really answer that question, but I can tell you that because the premiums have gone up so much this year and because I don't qualify for any kind of government subsidies, I don't have, for the first time in my life, insurance.	0
508	QUESTION	It's just not affordable.	0
509	QUESTION	Unfortunately, the prices of my services just don't warrant it.	0
510	SANDERS	Let me just say this, two things.	0
511	SANDERS	Number one, as I mentioned earlier, it is absolutely true that the cost of premiums are going up.	0
512	SANDERS	No argument.	0
513	SANDERS	They went up even higher during the period of George W.  Bush.	0
514	SANDERS	So it's not like, oh, gee, for the first time in American history, premiums are going up.	0
515	SANDERS	Number two, Ted mentioned part-time work, the 29ers.	0
516	SANDERS	Well, there are fewer part-time employees today than there were before Obamacare, OK?	0
517	SANDERS	So here is the point.	0
518	SANDERS	The bottom line is with -- the situation you've described is honestly absurd.	0
519	SANDERS	You should not be going around without health insurance.	0
520	SANDERS	Your employees should not be going around without health insurance.	0
521	SANDERS	We should not be spending twice as much per person on health care as do the people of any other nation.	1
522	SANDERS	Please join me and fight for a Medicare for all program.	0
523	SANDERS	Are you looking forward -- by the way, I'm not going to ask you your age -- won't do that -- but are you looking forward maybe when you get to 65 to get Medicare?	0
524	SANDERS	Would that be of help to your family?	0
525	QUESTION	I expect that that will probably happen.	0
526	SANDERS	Good.	0
527	SANDERS	Well, I certainly hope it does, and I hope Medicare is still there, despite the efforts of Senator Cruz and others, so that when you reach at least 65, you will be able to get a decent health insurance program.	0
528	CRUZ	Well, Bernie, since apparently I've now tried to kill the elderly...	0
529	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
530	CRUZ	... let me ask you a question.	0
531	CRUZ	When you heard that her premiums had skyrocketed, that she can't afford health insurance, you kind of said, well, premiums always go up.	0
532	CRUZ	I mean, let me ask you.	0
533	CRUZ	Why did President Obama look in the eyes of the American people and promise LaRonda that her health insurance premiums would go down $2,500 a year?	0
534	CRUZ	Was he telling the truth when he said that?	0
535	CRUZ	And were you and the other Democrats telling the truth when you echoed his promise to the American people?	0
536	SANDERS	Well, Ted, first thought, as everybody knows, health care is pretty complicated.	0
537	SANDERS	I think President Obama is an honest person, and I think, based on his assessment, that's what he believed.	0
538	CRUZ	Was it true?	0
539	SANDERS	But let me -- turns out not to be true, but it turns out to be that under Bush premiums went up higher.	0
540	SANDERS	Not a new thing.	0
541	SANDERS	Then the real question we should be talking about is why we do spend so much money on health care.	0
542	SANDERS	And that means that we have to appreciate that we are spending hundreds of billions of dollars every single year not on health care, but on administration and bureaucracy.	0
543	SANDERS	Do you know how much money it costs to bill you?	0
544	SANDERS	You've got people -- hundreds of people in large hospitals, they're sitting around not providing health care, they're working on paperwork, driving you crazy when you bring forth a claim.	0
545	SANDERS	So we have to figure out how we have a simple system that guarantees health care to all people.	0
546	SANDERS	When we do that, you and your employees will all have health insurance.	0
547	CRUZ	Well, there is an area actually where we agree, which is there is way too much paperwork with health care.	0
548	CRUZ	There's way too much complexity.	0
549	CRUZ	I'll tell you, when you talk to doctors, when you talk to nurses, they say, I don't get to practice health care anymore.	0
550	CRUZ	I spend all my time filling out paperwork.	0
551	CRUZ	All my time -- now, where the paperwork comes from is the government.	0
552	CRUZ	It comes from Obamacare.	0
553	CRUZ	In fact, there's some amazing stats I'm going to go back and get, because -- because they're really quite powerful.	0
554	CRUZ	If you look at the paperwork impact, Obamacare's rules alone -- and by the way, the Obamacare rules are 20,000 pages.	0
555	CRUZ	They're taller than seven feet tall.	0
556	CRUZ	They generate $51 billion in costs and more than 172 million hours of paperwork compliance.	0
557	CRUZ	And let me put that in perspective.	0
558	CRUZ	What does that mean?	0
559	CRUZ	That would take 86,200 employees, working full-time, 2,000 hours a year, to complete one year of new paperwork under Obamacare.	0
560	CRUZ	That's roughly the entire population of Miami Beach, Florida, doing nothing but filling out Obamacare forms.	0
561	CRUZ	If you want your doctor to get back to caring for you, if you want to drive down costs, get government out of the business of dictating and controlling health care.	0
562	SANDERS	Well, Ted is right.	0
563	SANDERS	There is far too much paperwork.	0
564	SANDERS	Some of it is government.	0
565	SANDERS	But you know what some of it is also?	0
566	SANDERS	It is insurance companies.	0
567	SANDERS	Every American who has filed a claim has the experience of fighting with the health insurance companies to make sure that they get what they are entitled to.	0
568	SANDERS	Doctors have to spend half of their lives arguing with the insurance companies as to whether or not they can prescribe the medicine their patients need or provide the therapy that their patients need.	0
569	SANDERS	Huge amount of waste.	0
570	SANDERS	That is why we need a simple system.	0
571	SANDERS	And, as Americans, we're going to have to make a very fundamental decision.	0
572	SANDERS	Very simple.	0
573	SANDERS	Is health care a right of all people?	0
574	SANDERS	Is it or not?	0
575	SANDERS	Ted doesn't think it is; I do think it is.	0
576	SANDERS	And then if we agree, and I think most Americans do, that it is a right, how do you provide health care to all people with high quality in a cost-effective way?	0
577	SANDERS	I happen to believe that Medicare is a popular program.	0
578	SANDERS	It works well.	0
579	SANDERS	Right now, you get it at 65.	0
580	SANDERS	I think every American should get Medicare.	0
581	BASH	Senator Sanders, I want to pick the discussion up right there if I may.	0
582	BASH	Senator Cruz...	0
583	CRUZ	Yeah, let me make a real quick point, just because I think...	0
584	BASH	Real quick.	0
585	BASH	Real quick.	0
586	CRUZ	It's nice having the back and forth and the...	0
587	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
588	BASH	It's lovely, absolutely.	0
589	CRUZ	One thing Bernie said that I think suggests maybe an area we could work together, you were talking about paperwork from insurance companies.	0
590	CRUZ	I agree, there's way too much paperwork for insurance companies.	0
591	CRUZ	I'd like insurance companies to have less power and patients to have more power.	0
592	CRUZ	So maybe you and I could agree on a commonsense reform of allowing LaRonda to purchase health insurance of any of the 50 states.	0
593	CRUZ	Right now, she's a Texan, it's illegal for her to purchase health insurance anywhere else.	0
594	CRUZ	That would give her choice.	0
595	CRUZ	If she doesn't like what the Texas companies are offering, she can go to Oklahoma, she can go to Florida, she can go to any other state.	0
596	CRUZ	That creates a 50-state national marketplace.	0
597	CRUZ	It drives down cost.	0
598	CRUZ	It increases choices.	0
599	CRUZ	Why don't we stand together against the insurance companies and agree on that reform?	0
600	SANDERS	Well, I think standing together for a Medicare for all single-payer system is a lot better idea.	0
601	BASH	OK.	0
602	SANDERS	Because -- OK, because when you have the idea that Ted was talking about, this is a race to the bottom.	0
603	SANDERS	And what you are going to end up with, some insurance company in Mississippi or someplace, they're going to provide you insurance.	0
604	SANDERS	But you think your deductibles are high now?	0
605	SANDERS	It will be a lot higher.	0
606	SANDERS	Look, Ted, and you're right.	0
607	SANDERS	This is a good discussion, all right?	0
608	SANDERS	And here is the issue.	0
609	SANDERS	Ted, let me ask you a question.	0
610	CRUZ	Sure.	0
611	SANDERS	Is every American entitled -- and I underline that word -- to health care as a right of being an American?	0
612	SANDERS	Yes or no?	0
613	CRUZ	You know, I'm glad you asked that.	0
614	CRUZ	You know, right is a word you use a lot.	0
615	CRUZ	Let's talk about what rights are.	0
616	CRUZ	Rights mean you have a right for government not to mess with you, for government not to do things with you.	0
617	CRUZ	If you look at the Bill of Rights, the Bill of Rights, free speech means the government can't silence you when you're speaking.	0
618	CRUZ	Religious liberty means the government can't control who you worship, what your faith is.	0
619	CRUZ	The Second Amendment means the government can't take away your guns.	0
620	CRUZ	Those are rights.	0
621	CRUZ	You know, what the Declaration of Independence said, we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.	0
622	CRUZ	So what is a right is access to health care.	0
623	CRUZ	What is a right is choosing your own doctor.	0
624	CRUZ	And if you believe health care is a right, why on Earth did you help write Obamacare that caused six million people to have their health insurance canceled, that had them lose their doctors, and have people like LaRonda, who can't get health insurance, can't afford premiums...	1
625	SANDERS	For a start...	0
626	CRUZ	You're denying her what you say is her right.	0
627	SANDERS	Well, two things.	0
628	SANDERS	You didn't answer the question, although I interpret your question to be that LaRonda does not have a right.	0
629	CRUZ	No, that's not what I said.	0
630	SANDERS	Woah, woah, woah, I heard the Bill of Rights.	0
631	CRUZ	What I said is access to health care.	0
632	CRUZ	Access to health care is a right.	0
633	SANDERS	She has access.	0
634	SANDERS	But she doesn't have enough money.	0
635	CRUZ	And choosing your doctor is a right.	0
636	SANDERS	Look, LaRonda, you have access right now.	0
637	SANDERS	Go out and get a really great health insurance program.	0
638	SANDERS	Oh, you can't do it?	0
639	SANDERS	Because you can't afford it.	0
640	SANDERS	All right?	0
641	SANDERS	That's what he's saying.	0
642	SANDERS	Access to what?	0
643	SANDERS	You want to buy one of Donald Trump's mansions?	0
644	SANDERS	You have access to do that, as well.	0
645	SANDERS	Oh, you can't afford $5 million for a house?	0
646	SANDERS	Sorry.	0
647	SANDERS	Access doesn't mean a damn thing.	0
648	SANDERS	What it means is whether people can afford it, can get the health care that they need.	0
649	CRUZ	And they can't under Obamacare.	0
650	SANDERS	Second of all, let's -- some people have problems, no question about it.	0
651	SANDERS	I'm not arguing with you on that, Ted.	0
652	SANDERS	But don't argue with me when I tell you that 20 million more people did get health insurance, all right?	0
653	SANDERS	We used to have 48 million people in this country who had zero insurance before Obamacare.	0
654	SANDERS	Now that number, much too high, is 28 million.	0
655	SANDERS	Last point.	0
656	SANDERS	Ted talked to the young people, and he said, I want you to go out with enthusiasm, go out and go to -- get a job.	0
657	SANDERS	He's right.	0
658	SANDERS	But under Ted's ideas, if Obamacare is repealed, right now, if you're under 26, you can stay in your parents' insurance program.	0
659	SANDERS	That's one of the things we did in Obamacare.	0
660	SANDERS	Good idea.	0
661	SANDERS	Ted would repeal that.	0
662	SANDERS	So as you go out into the real world, be very careful about not having an accident.	0
663	BASH	Senators...	0
664	SANDERS	Because you don't have any health insurance.	0
665	BASH	I want to tell our audience, we're going to take a quick break.	0
666	BASH	We have a lot more to discuss.	0
667	BASH	More of CNN's debate night and the future of ae Obamacare right after this.	0
668	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
669	TAPPER	Welcome back to the CNN health care debate with Senators Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders.	0
670	TAPPER	Senators, thanks so much for participating here.	0
671	TAPPER	I want to ask you, since Obamacare was enacted, governors of 31 states, plus the District of Columbia, have opted to expand Medicaid through federal funding, providing insurance to 11 million low income people.	0
672	TAPPER	One of the Americans who benefitted from the Obamacare Medicaid expansion is Carol Hardaway of Salisbury, Maryland.	0
673	TAPPER	Carol?	0
674	QUESTION	Thank you.	0
675	QUESTION	I have multiple sclerosis, but could not afford insurance.	0
676	QUESTION	Without the treatment or medications I need, I had problems with walking, with my speech, and my vision.	0
677	QUESTION	When the Affordable Care Act was passed, I moved from our home state of Texas -- because they refused to expand Medicaid -- to Maryland, and within two weeks, I started receiving treatments through Medicaid and am now well enough to work as a substitute teach.	0
678	QUESTION	Senator Cruz, can you promise me that you and the Republican leaders in Congress will have -- actually have a replacement plan in place for people like me who depend on their Medicaid?	0
679	QUESTION	In other words, I like my coverage.	0
680	QUESTION	Can I keep it?	0
681	CRUZ	Well, Carol, thank you for sharing your story.	0
682	CRUZ	And congratulations on dealing with MS.	0
683	CRUZ	It's a terrible disease.	0
684	CRUZ	And congratulations on your struggles dealing with it.	0
685	CRUZ	You know, if you look at Medicaid, more than half of the people who have been covered under Obamacare have been under Medicaid.	0
686	CRUZ	And the problem is:  Medicaid is a profoundly troubled program.	0
687	CRUZ	And so it may be working well with you, but I'll tell you nationally, the health outcomes under Medicaid are really poor.	1
688	CRUZ	Nationally, 54 percent of doctors won't take new Medicaid patients.	0
689	CRUZ	Nationally, dental care appointments for moms are denied at a 63 percent rate on Medicaid.	0
690	CRUZ	The denial rate for private insurance is 4 percent.	0
691	CRUZ	And Medicaid patients are almost twice as likely to die from medical treatment as those with private health insurance.	0
692	CRUZ	The solution for people who are hurting, I believe, we should have a system that allows as many people as possible to be on the private health insurance of your choice rather than Medicaid, because the Medicaid outcomes are not working and people are suffering.	0
693	CRUZ	And what's happened also -- it's really quite striking -- because Obamacare dramatically expanded Medicaid, many of the people who had been on Medicaid, many of the people who are really suffering and needy, have found their wait times increasing.	0
694	CRUZ	In fact in Illinois, on Medicaid, over 700 people have died on the waiting list for care for Medicaid.	0
695	CRUZ	So, I'm glad that you're receiving healthcare.	0
696	CRUZ	I can tell you a great many of the people on Medicaid aren't.	0
697	CRUZ	And I'd much rather see a system where we can have millions of those on Medicaid getting health insurance.	0
698	CRUZ	The only way we can is if we have competition so that rates are lower so you can afford to have health insurance.	0
699	JAKE TAPPER, CNN DEBATE MODERATOR	Senator Sanders?	0
700	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	We heard from a woman who runs a hair salon in Ft. Worth who can't afford to provide health insurance for her workers and herself.	0
701	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	We hear a story now about a woman who has to leave her own state and go to another state because that state is providing Medicaid.	0
702	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	My friends, you are living -- I know you don't know this -- by these stories.	0
703	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	You're living in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, where the rich are becoming phenomenally richer while we have 43 million people living in poverty and the middle class is in decline.	0
704	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	These stories are obscene.	0
705	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	They should not be taking place in the United States.	0
706	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	Now, are there problems with Medicaid?	0
707	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	Of course, there are.	0
708	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	But I will tell you something, to those Republicans governors around the country who told poor people that they would not be able to, for the first time in their lives in many instances, get access to healthcare, to be able to go to a doctor when the federal government paid for the first three years at 100 percent.	0
709	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	I hope that those governors sleep well at night, because I don't know how many people lost their lives as a result of their decision.	0
710	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	So, once again, what we are looking at is a dysfunctional system.	0
711	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	We spend more, we get less.	0
712	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	People who work hard have no health insurance.	0
713	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	People have to move from one state or the other.	0
714	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	This country finally is going to have to do, in my view, what every other major country does.	0
715	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	And yes, I believe, Ted, healthcare is a human right.	0
716	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	And I believe that this country has got to join every other major country and say, you can stay home and get quality care because you're an American.	0
717	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	You can run your small business well and get care because you are an American.	0
718	SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT	That is where we have got to go.	0
719	CRUZ	Well, you know, when Bernie says, well, Medicaid has problems.	0
720	CRUZ	You want to talk about people who lost their rights, 742 people in Illinois were put on a waiting list for Medicaid after Illinois expanded its Medicaid, Barack Obama's home state, and they died awaiting care under Medicaid.	0
721	CRUZ	Why?	0
722	CRUZ	Because Medicaid is rationed care.	0
723	CRUZ	Those wait lists -- you know, Bernie likes to talk about medical care for all.	0
724	CRUZ	But let me be clear what his program is.	0
725	CRUZ	It's Medicaid for all.	0
726	CRUZ	It is rationed care nationally.	0
727	CRUZ	You want to know what that looks like.	0
728	CRUZ	He keeps pointing to other countries.	0
729	CRUZ	Let's look at, for example, the United Kingdom.	0
730	CRUZ	The United Kingdom, a 2001 report noted that 39 percent over 80 in the United Kingdom received surgery for breast cancer, compared to 90 percent of the women under 50.	0
731	CRUZ	And that women under -- men and women under the age of 55 were 2 1/2 times more likely than those over 75 to receive cancer treatments.	0
732	CRUZ	More than 80 percent of older patients in the United Kingdom believe they're discriminated against by their government-run healthcare.	0
733	CRUZ	You want to know what rationing looks like.	0
734	CRUZ	It looks like Medicaid.	0
735	CRUZ	It looks like the people who are suffering.	0
736	CRUZ	And if you look at this country, across this country, we have 291 million people roughly that are covered by insurance.	0
737	CRUZ	I don't think we should be screwing up the insurance of millions of Americans and putting them under rationing.	0
738	CRUZ	That's what Obamacare has moved us down the road to doing and it's not working	0
739	SANDERS	OK, Ted correctly indicates Medicaid has problems and Vermont has problems.	0
740	SANDERS	All over the country, it has problems.	0
741	SANDERS	You know what Ted's solution is?	0
742	SANDERS	Massive cuts in federal funding for Medicaid.	0
743	SANDERS	So, you've got a problem and what Ted wants to do is make it worse.	0
744	SANDERS	You mentioned dental care.	0
745	SANDERS	Maybe you want to go on my bill, which will provide dental care to tens of millions of American who can't afford it right now.	0
746	SANDERS	What we need to do, by the way, is to tell dentists out there that they may have to do more than just make you have a nice smile.	0
747	SANDERS	But they may have to provide real dental care to children and others who absolutely need it.	0
748	SANDERS	Furthermore, what we have to do is we need tens of thousands more doctors in this country.	0
749	SANDERS	We have a major crisis in primary care.	0
750	SANDERS	There are areas in urban America and in rural America where people literally can't find a doctor to serve their needs.	0
751	SANDERS	And one of the reasons, a number of reasons for that, one of them is you go to medical school, you can come out hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.	0
752	SANDERS	And then you're going to become a plastic surgeon not doing primary care in an urban area or rural America, which tells me we've got to expand the program called the National Health Service Corps so that our young people can get their debts repaid if they commit to serving in under-served areas.	0
753	SANDERS	Let's get doctors out into the areas where we need them.	0
754	TAPPER	Let me just jump in if I can.	0
755	TAPPER	Carol, you just shake your head.	0
756	TAPPER	Did Senator Cruz, your former senator, did he answer your question?	0
757	TAPPER	No, he did not.	0
758	TAPPER	The question was, Senator Cruz, can you promise me that you and the Republican leaders in Congress will actually have a replacement plan in place for people like me who depend on their Medicaid?	0
759	TAPPER	She got Medicaid through the Obamacare expansion of Medicaid.	0
760	TAPPER	We've all heard you criticize Medicaid.	0
761	TAPPER	What happens to Carol?	0
762	CRUZ	Well, what I said, Jake, is that Medicaid isn't working for millions of people and Obamacare made Medicaid worse by expanding the wait lists by jamming more people on it.	0
763	CRUZ	You want to talk about replacement, there's widespread agreement on replacement plans.	0
764	CRUZ	Number one, allowing people to purchase across state lines, giving you more choice.	0
765	CRUZ	Now, Bernie said he opposes that.	0
766	CRUZ	He doesn't want to let you buy insurance in other states.	0
767	CRUZ	Number two, expanding health savings accounts so you can save in a tax advantaged way to meet your own healthcare needs.	0
768	CRUZ	Number three, making health insurance portable so that it goes with you from job to job.	0
769	CRUZ	I imagine, ma'am, at some point, you had insurance with a job?	0
770	CRUZ	If insurance was portable right now, federal tax law incentivizes -- most of us get our insurance from the government and if you lose your -- or not from the government, from our employer rather.	0
771	CRUZ	And if you lose your job, you lose that insurance.	0
772	CRUZ	One of the best solutions to the problem of preexisting conditions is making health insurance portable that goes with you.	0
773	CRUZ	You know, when you lose your job, you don't lose your car insurance, your life insurance, your house insurance.	0
774	CRUZ	There's no reason to lose your health insurance.	0
775	CRUZ	And if your insurance is portable, it goes with you.	0
776	CRUZ	It's affordable.	0
777	CRUZ	You have choices.	0
778	CRUZ	Now, notice Bernie's solution, we want more doctors.	0
779	CRUZ	We all agree on more doctors.	0
780	CRUZ	He says, well, the government needs to hire more.	0
781	CRUZ	You know, I can point to something that works on that.	0
782	CRUZ	In Texas, we passed tort reform.	0
783	CRUZ	We fundamentally limited lawsuits and lawsuit abuse.	0
784	CRUZ	And you know what we've seen -- we've seen the number of doctors increasing dramatically.	0
785	CRUZ	We've seen medical malpractice premiums dropping.	0
786	CRUZ	Those are the kind of solutions supported at the state level that will result in more doctors.	0
787	CRUZ	But Obamacare is discouraging people from going to medical school and training to be doctors.	0
788	SANDERS	Well, Ted, I didn't want to raise it, but you brought it forth.	0
789	SANDERS	You know what state in the country -- and I don't blame you for this -- but what state in the country has the highest rate of uninsured in America by far?	0
790	SANDERS	It is the state of Texas.	0
791	SANDERS	And, by the way, may I say proudly that Vermont is number two in terms of the percentage of people who are insured.	0
792	SANDERS	We have relatively few uninsured.	0
793	SANDERS	And, by the way, amazingly enough, you know what state in the country has the highest rate of people insured?	0
794	SANDERS	It is Massachusetts with RomneyCare, which was the prototype for the Affordable Care Act.	0
795	CRUZ	Well, you know, the nice thing, Bernie, again, people vote with their feet.	0
796	CRUZ	And for north of a decade now, roughly a thousand people a day have been moving to Texas because we have an environment that allows people to get jobs.	0
797	CRUZ	And so, people vote with their feet.	0
798	CRUZ	And you're right, there are states, Vermont is a lovely state.	0
799	CRUZ	It doesn't have a ton of diversity.	0
800	CRUZ	It doesn't have nearly the populations Texas has that are populations that are just starting -- when my dad went to Texas in 1957 when he was 18, he couldn't speak English.	0
801	CRUZ	He was from Cuba.	0
802	CRUZ	He had $100 in his underwear.	0
803	CRUZ	He watched dishes making 50 cents an hour.	0
804	CRUZ	You know what?	0
805	CRUZ	He didn't have healthcare.	0
806	CRUZ	But he came to go to the University of Texas, he came to get	0
807	CRUZ	opportunity.	0
808	CRUZ	That job enabled him to get another job where he could get healthcare.	0
809	CRUZ	That's a much better solution.	0
810	CRUZ	Create an environment where you don't tax the living daylights out of people.	0
811	CRUZ	It's why people choose --	0
812	DANA BASH, CNN DEBATE MODERATOR	Senators --	0
813	CRUZ	-- to be where they get --	0
814	BASH	Senators --	0
815	SANDERS	Aren't we all happy that under Obama, we created 15 million new jobs in the private sector?	0
816	BASH	Senators, I want to get to more audience questions.	0
817	BASH	This one is about the fact that the Affordable Care Act requires that all insurance plans cover what the law calls essential health benefits.	0
818	BASH	This includes maternity and delivery costs.	0
819	BASH	We have a question on what will happen to that coverage for Maria Shahid Rowe, who is pregnant with her second child.	0
820	BASH	Maria?	0
821	MARIA SHAHID ROWE, NURSING STUDENT, PREGNANT WITH SECOND CHILD	Thank you.	0
822	MARIA SHAHID ROWE, NURSING STUDENT, PREGNANT WITH SECOND CHILD	I'm a nursing student at the Medical University of South Carolina.	0
823	MARIA SHAHID ROWE, NURSING STUDENT, PREGNANT WITH SECOND CHILD	And I'm concerned about the implications that repealing the Affordable Care Act will have on women's health and specifically for pregnant women.	0
824	MARIA SHAHID ROWE, NURSING STUDENT, PREGNANT WITH SECOND CHILD	So, I'm five months pregnant and I'm actually qualified for Medicaid due to being a full-time student.	0
825	MARIA SHAHID ROWE, NURSING STUDENT, PREGNANT WITH SECOND CHILD	My husband works for a church.	0
826	MARIA SHAHID ROWE, NURSING STUDENT, PREGNANT WITH SECOND CHILD	We live in a very modest income at the moment.	0
827	MARIA SHAHID ROWE, NURSING STUDENT, PREGNANT WITH SECOND CHILD	Senator Cruz, what policies do you have in place to protect pregnant women from losing their health coverage either due to being considered having a preexisting condition or from being charged higher insurance premiums than men?	0
828	CRUZ	Well, congratulations on your new baby.	0
829	CRUZ	Is it a boy or girl?	0
830	ROWE	It's a surprise.	0
831	CRUZ	Oh, wonderful.	0
832	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
833	CRUZ	And you said you have an older child?	0
834	CRUZ	What's your older child?	0
835	ROWE	We have a 2-year-old son.	0
836	CRUZ	What's his name?	0
837	ROWE	Samson.	0
838	CRUZ	Well, maybe you have Delilah and that would be --	0
839	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
840	CRUZ	Well, how wonderful and congratulations.	0
841	ROWE	Thank you.	0
842	CRUZ	Heidi and I have two little girls at home and it is a wonderful, wonderful thing.	0
843	CRUZ	Listen, cover -- maternity coverage is incredibly important.	0
844	CRUZ	But here's how Obamacare worked -- you had a lot of politicians in Washington who said we're going to mandate every coverage on Earth.	0
845	CRUZ	And it sounds really good.	0
846	CRUZ	You know, I had a conversation a couple of years ago with a gentleman in Amarillo, Texas, who told me the story about his 101-year-old aunt who had just had her insurance cancelled.	0
847	CRUZ	And she said the reason it was cancelled was that it didn't cover maternity care.	0
848	CRUZ	Now, this fellow laughed and said, my aunt is 101 years old.	0
849	CRUZ	She doesn't really need maternity coverage right now.	0
850	CRUZ	We should have a system, I believe, where you can choose to get the policies that meet your needs.	0
851	CRUZ	And the impact, especially for young people, of all the mandated coverage -- you know, it's interesting the Democrats view -- they're big on talking about insurance coverage.	0
852	CRUZ	But it's a little bit like giving everyone a bus ticket when there are no buses.	0
853	CRUZ	What we should care about is access to healthcare, not just insurance per se.	0
854	CRUZ	And what's happened under Obamacare is that millions of people can't afford it.	0
855	CRUZ	We should be concerned about people being able to afford health insurance.	0
856	CRUZ	And that means giving them the choice in 50 states to choose a policy.	0
857	CRUZ	In your instance, you would choose a politician that had maternity coverage.	0
858	CRUZ	But someone else who right now kind of can't afford might choose a different policy.	0
859	BASH	Senator --	0
860	CRUZ	And when government mandates it, those choices go away.	0
861	BASH	Senator Sanders, your response?	0
862	SANDERS	What Ted is really telling you is that they will not guarantee coverage for you.	0
863	SANDERS	And not every pregnancy is planned and if a woman under -- a pregnant woman before Obamacare, you know what you were considered to be?	0
864	SANDERS	A preexisting condition.	0
865	SANDERS	And why would an insurance company want to provide care to you when having a baby is a fairly expensive proposition?	0
866	SANDERS	You don't make money doing that.	0
867	SANDERS	And Ted keeps talking about these mandates.	0
868	SANDERS	So, let's be clear again what Senator Cruz and his Republican friends want to do.	0
869	SANDERS	They do not want to guarantee that women who become pregnant will be able to get the healthcare and the prenatal care that they need -- which is a terrible thing, by the way, because we have one of the highest infant mortality rates in the industrialized world.	0
870	SANDERS	He says to young people who today are on their parents' program -- you're out, you're on your own after you leave college.	0
871	SANDERS	He says that if you come down with a terrible illness and you're ending up spending hundreds of thousands of dollars, your insurance company can now tell you that there is a limit to what they will pay.	0
872	SANDERS	And he is telling 20 million people who gained health insurance under Obamacare -- sorry, you're out on the streets.	0
873	SANDERS	Bottom line is: once again, the discussion, if you really think about the kind of discussion that we're having, it is an absurd discussion for the wealthiest nation in the history of the world.	0
874	BASH	Senator Sanders, let me follow up on that.	0
875	CRUZ	I want to respond to that briefly.	0
876	BASH	Please?	0
877	BASH	Go ahead.	0
878	CRUZ	You know, it's interesting sometimes the rhetoric that our friends on the left like to say that anyone who doesn't support government control of our healthcare somehow doesn't like and fit in whatever population you're talking about.	0
879	CRUZ	But let's again go back to facts and let's talk about young people.	0
880	CRUZ	You know, there's no group in America that's been hurt more by Obamacare than young people.	0
881	CRUZ	Young people were left on the chopping block.	0
882	CRUZ	Let's talk about some basic stats.	0
883	CRUZ	A recent study found that the Obamacare mandates, what Bernie just sang an ode to, have increased -- the three costliest mandates have increased premiums for younger people by 44 percent.	0
884	CRUZ	Without those mandates, the typical 21-year-old would pay $1,100 a year less.	0
885	CRUZ	If you're 21, think about whether it would be easier to afford healthcare if it cost $1,100 a year less.	0
886	CRUZ	And let's talk about some specifics.	0
887	CRUZ	Before Obamacare, the most affordable plan that was available for a 30-year-old Texan, for a 30- year-old Texan woman was $470 a year.	0
888	CRUZ	Today, under Obamacare, the cheapest plan that's available for a healthy 30-year-old woman in Ft. Worth is $3,236.	0
889	CRUZ	It's gone from $470 to $3,000, over $3,200.	0
890	CRUZ	That's why young people are hurting.	0
891	CRUZ	And what Obamacare did is it jacked up the rates on all the young people.	0
892	CRUZ	Why do you think there's an individual mandate?	0
893	CRUZ	It's to force young people to pay really high rates to subsidize the rest of the system.	0
894	CRUZ	And if you don't pay it, the IRS fines you.	0
895	CRUZ	And, you know, over 6 million people are fined each year by the IRS under Obamacare.	0
896	CRUZ	That's who -- (CROSSTALK)	0
897	BASH	Senator, we're going to get to the question of fines and so forth in a minute.	0
898	BASH	But I want to circle back to women's health and ask you, Senator Sanders, why should a 60-year-old male or women beyond childbearing years be required to have health insurance plans that have maternity care?	0
899	SANDERS	I don't think they should.	0
900	BASH	That's what Obama --	0
901	SANDERS	That's one of the things we might want to look at.	0
902	BASH	OK.	0
903	SANDERS	But I do believe that in the United States of America, where we talk a lot about our love for children, that pregnancy is not and should not be considered a preexisting condition.	0
904	SANDERS	That every woman in this country who gets pregnant should be 100 percent assured that she is going to get the highest quality care she needs to deliver a healthy baby.	0
905	BASH	Senator Cruz, I want to stay on the issue of women's health.	0
906	BASH	Under Obamacare, women pay nothing out-of-pocket for birth control.	0
907	BASH	So, will that continue under any Republican replacement?	0
908	CRUZ	It's going to be a choice for each patient to make.	0
909	CRUZ	Listen, Obamacare is all about these mandates.	0
910	CRUZ	And you know, Margaret Thatcher famously said, the problem with socialism, eventually you run out of other people's money.	0
911	CRUZ	The same is true with the mandates.	0
912	CRUZ	Every mandate, people will say, gosh, I like the -- imagine if the federal government mandated that everyone in America must drive a Lamborghini.	0
913	CRUZ	I've never driven a Lamborghini.	0
914	CRUZ	I mean, they look kind of fun.	0
915	CRUZ	But you know what?	0
916	CRUZ	I'm willing to bet most of us, if that was the mandate -- and it would be cool, you sit in a leather seat, you could go 200 miles an hour, what it would mean for most people is you couldn't afford a car?	0
917	CRUZ	If they said, but, you know, gosh, the VW Bug is not fancy enough.	0
918	CRUZ	You need everything.	0
919	CRUZ	For most people who can't afford it, it doesn't work.	0
920	CRUZ	That's what Obamacare is doing.	0
921	CRUZ	I would love for everyone to have maximum coverage on everything, but there's no magic fairy with pixie dust that gives it away for free.	0
922	CRUZ	These mandates are hurting people because it's putting people in a situation like Rolanda (ph) where they get nothing, they don't get healthcare of any kind.	0
923	CRUZ	Her employees don't get healthcare because Obamacare has driven the cost up.	0
924	CRUZ	That's why people are hurting so much under it.	0
925	SANDERS	Two points.	0
926	SANDERS	Our employees are not getting healthcare because in Texas, you did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.	0
927	CRUZ	No.	0
928	CRUZ	She has 49 employees.	0
929	CRUZ	She is not covered under it.	0
930	CRUZ	She's	0
931	CRUZ	not hiring more because --	0
932	SANDERS	Lower income people would be eligible for Medicaid.	0
933	SANDERS	Second of all, I think that it is very clear that the discussion that we're having when Ted talks about mandates, I look at it differently.	0
934	SANDERS	And also, what we should be clear about is Ted says, well, just not enough money, we can't all drive fancy cars.	0
935	SANDERS	I think it's a bit disingenuous to talk about driving a fancy car with getting access to healthcare when you're sick.	0
936	SANDERS	Last point on this issues, if we repeal the Affordable Care Act, we are going to provide $346 billion in tax breaks to the top 2 percent.	1
937	SANDERS	Ted in other ways goes even further.	0
938	SANDERS	He wants to repeal the estate tax which applies to the top 2/10 of 1 percent, the very wealthiest people in this country, and give them collectively hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks.	0
939	SANDERS	Ted, we are the wealthiest country in the world.	0
940	SANDERS	And it's not a question of everybody driving a fancy car, but it is a question to making sure that every man, woman and child in this country has healthcare as a right.	0
941	TAPPER	I want to bring back to a subject --	0
942	CRUZ	Jake, let me respond to that real quickly.	0
943	CRUZ	I know this gentleman has a question, but I want to respond --	0
944	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
945	TAPPER	-- going to talk about the estate tax.	0
946	CRUZ	What Bernie said, real quickly, I want to respond to just briefly.	0
947	TAPPER	OK.	0
948	CRUZ	Which, you know, it was interesting -- in the course of the campaign last year, encounter young people all over the country.	0
949	CRUZ	There were a lot of young people supported our campaign.	0
950	CRUZ	A lot of young people supported Bernie, and I would talk with different people supporting Bernie.	0
951	CRUZ	And I'd say to them, typically young people, I'd say, "You know what?	0
952	CRUZ	I agree with Bernie."	0
953	CRUZ	And they sort of look at me, they'd be startled.	0
954	CRUZ	They said, "What are you talking about?"	0
955	CRUZ	I said, listen, Bernie talks about how Washington is corrupt, how both parties, how both parties are in bed with big business and big money and it is a corrupt system benefitting special interests.	0
956	CRUZ	I agree absolutely and entirely.	0
957	CRUZ	And what I tell folks is where I disagree is in his solution.	0
958	CRUZ	If the problem is government is corrupt, why on earth would you want more power in Washington?	0
959	CRUZ	I want to take power out of Washington and empower the people.	0
960	CRUZ	When it comes to taxes, what I want a simple flat tax of 10 percent for everyone and abolish the IRS.	0
961	CRUZ	That ends the power of lobbyists.	0
962	CRUZ	It ends the power of Washington.	0
963	CRUZ	That's a solution empowers the people.	0
964	TAPPER	We're going to --	0
965	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
966	SANDERS	One second.	0
967	SANDERS	In the midst of massive unprecedented income and wealth inequality, Ted's plan according to "Wall Street Journal" would give incredible tax breaks to top 1 percent.	0
968	TAPPER	OK, we'll do another -- we'll do another town hall debate on tax reform.	0
969	CRUZ	Good.	0
970	TAPPER	OK?	0
971	TAPPER	We're going to take a very quick break.	0
972	TAPPER	And when we come back, a subject where there might be some agreement.	0
973	TAPPER	The debate continues with Senators Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders in a moment.	0
974	TAPPER	Stay with us.	0
975	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
976	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
977	TAPPER	Welcome back to the CNN debate on the future of Obamacare.	0
978	TAPPER	Let's turn now to the rise in prescription drug costs.	0
979	TAPPER	For that, I want to bring in Cole Gelrod.	0
980	TAPPER	He comes from Denver, Colorado.	0
981	TAPPER	He's a father of two whose daughter Juniper requires medication that would cost $900 a month without Medicaid.	0
982	TAPPER	Cole?	0
983	COLE GELROD, DAUGHTER HAD HEART TRANSPLANT	Thank you.	0
984	COLE GELROD, DAUGHTER HAD HEART TRANSPLANT	My 3-year-old daughter born with undiagnosed severe heart defect and required a heart transplant when she was only at 7 months old.	0
985	COLE GELROD, DAUGHTER HAD HEART TRANSPLANT	Unfortunately for us and families like ours, our employer-provided insurance does not cover the most vital of my daughter's life-saving prescriptions.	0
986	COLE GELROD, DAUGHTER HAD HEART TRANSPLANT	This luckily hasn't been unbearable financial burden for my family because of Obamacare, and particularly the Medicaid expansion.	0
987	COLE GELROD, DAUGHTER HAD HEART TRANSPLANT	Senator Cruz, regardless of what happens with health care reform, how do you plan to address the rising cost of prescription drugs?	0
988	COLE GELROD, DAUGHTER HAD HEART TRANSPLANT	Additionally, how would you like to address a healthcare insurance where companies can choose to not cover drugs that people like my daughter need to live?	0
989	CRUZ	Well, thank you for the question and thank you for the care you give to your 3-year-old daughter.	0
990	CRUZ	I know that is not easy.	0
991	CRUZ	And the question you ask is one of the great challenges facing this	0
992	CRUZ	country as we've seen the cost of drugs increasing dramatically.	0
993	CRUZ	One area Bernie and I talked about, we agree on, is allowing importation of drugs into this country from other countries where they are cheaper.	0
994	CRUZ	There's no reason why we should be subsidizing other countries across the globe.	0
995	CRUZ	But another fundamental area is FDA reform, where the costs of getting a new drug approved are prohibitively expensive.	0
996	CRUZ	I don't know if you've ever seen, or folks have ever seen the movie "Dallas Buyers' Club".	0
997	CRUZ	It's a wonderful movie with Matthew McConaughey about a gentleman in Texas who had AIDS, and wanted to get drugs to care for and the FDA wouldn't allow it here and he would travel to Mexico, he traveled to Japan, he traveled all over the world trying to get life- saving drugs.	0
998	CRUZ	There are story after story after story of exactly that happening.	0
999	CRUZ	Life-saving drugs that are available, that are approved.	0
1000	CRUZ	They're used in Europe.	0
1001	CRUZ	They're used in Canada, and the FDA won't allow it.	0
1002	CRUZ	That's why I think FDA reform is so valuable that if we lift the barriers, to let people try, give you a right to try.	0
1003	CRUZ	If it's your life, you have a right to choose.	0
1004	CRUZ	You have a right to try.	0
1005	CRUZ	The key to it is competition.	0
1006	CRUZ	Listen, the big boys, the big players like government regulation.	0
1007	CRUZ	Dodd-Frank benefitted the big banks.	0
1008	CRUZ	Tough FDA barriers to entry benefit the big pharmaceutical companies.	0
1009	CRUZ	Massive complexity in tax laws benefits big corporations.	0
1010	CRUZ	By reducing those barriers, we have competition and there's opportunity.	0
1011	CRUZ	I believe we can have innovative cures.	0
1012	CRUZ	To give you a sense, the four most devastating diseases in terms of human life and dollars, heart disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes and cancer.	0
1013	CRUZ	We ought to be investing everything we can to cure those diseases.	0
1014	CRUZ	Just curing cancer, an incredible achievement, would save $50 trillion and countless lives across the globe.	0
1015	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator --	0
1016	CRUZ	And the FDA is a barrier to doing that.	0
1017	CRUZ	We need to change them.	0
1018	TAPPER	Senator Sanders?	0
1019	SANDERS	Here is the simple issue:  we pay -- just as the case with health care -- we pay by far once again the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.	0
1020	SANDERS	Fifteen years ago, you know what I need?	0
1021	SANDERS	I took a bus load of women, working-class women from Vermont dealing with breast cancer across the Canadian border and they were able to purchase Tamoxifen, it's a widely used breast cancer drug, at that point.	0
1022	SANDERS	It's changed -- for 1/10th the price they're paying in the United States of America.	0
1023	SANDERS	Tears were coming of these working class women's eyes fighting for their lives.	0
1024	SANDERS	What's going on?	0
1025	SANDERS	What's going on is the pharmaceutical industry owns	0
1026	SANDERS	the United States Congress.	0
1027	SANDERS	And in all fairness, I will admit, it's not just Republicans.	0
1028	SANDERS	They have a huge influence over the Democratic Party as well.	0
1029	SANDERS	So, right now, the reality is uniquely in the whole world, you can walk in tomorrow to the -- your pharmacy, the cost that you pay for medicine could be double or triple, and there's nothing anybody can do about it.	0
1030	SANDERS	So, what do we have to do?	0
1031	SANDERS	We have to tell the pharmaceutical industry which in 2015 made $50 billion in profit for the five major companies where the top ten executives made over $300 million in compensation, we're going to have to be very loud and clear, and say, stop ripping off the American people.	0
1032	SANDERS	Two things that we can do immediately -- Ted is right.	0
1033	SANDERS	I introduced and will introduce and look forward to your co-sponsorship of legislation to say that pharmacists and distributors and the American people should be able to buy FDA-approved medicine anyplace in the world.	0
1034	SANDERS	That will drive down prices in this country, because then you'll have international competition.	0
1035	SANDERS	Second thing we need to do, and I believe, believe it or not, I think even Donald Trump may be on board this, hard to believe, but we should be negotiating drug prices through Medicare.	0
1036	SANDERS	Medicare spends zillions of dollars for medicines.	0
1037	SANDERS	Right now Republicans put language in some years ago which prevents them from negotiating prices.	0
1038	SANDERS	I would hope Ted will join me in saying that Medicare should be able to do what the V.A.	0
1039	SANDERS	does.	0
1040	SANDERS	We can lower prices as well.	0
1041	SANDERS	But the bottom line here is, you've got 1,400 well-paid lobbyists right now and they are working, if I may say this, they're working against you.	0
1042	SANDERS	They're working against your daughter.	0
1043	SANDERS	The only thing they want is more and more profit.	0
1044	SANDERS	And they could care less about the needs of the American people.	0
1045	CRUZ	Well, but, Bernie, the barriers are also coming from government.	0
1046	CRUZ	And I will give an example.	0
1047	CRUZ	A Texas constituent Kaci Lay (ph) has a 7-year-old daughter who was put on a feeding tube when she was 7 months old.	0
1048	CRUZ	And there's a drug called Domperidone that is used all across the world to treat the condition she has called gastroparesis.	0
1049	CRUZ	She was put on Domperidone, this 7-month-old girl.	0
1050	CRUZ	She was off the feeding tube.	0
1051	CRUZ	She was living well.	0
1052	CRUZ	Domperidone is available in more than 100 countries, including Canada and throughout the European Union.	0
1053	CRUZ	But the FDA has been aggressively enforcing an import ban here.	0
1054	CRUZ	And I'll tell you what Kaci's mother said, "I fear she will need to get a feeding tube again.	0
1055	CRUZ	How do I tell her that?	0
1056	CRUZ	She's a little girl who has worked extremely hard to overcome her fears of eating and now her joy of just being a normal little girl will be taken away."	0
1057	CRUZ	We shouldn't have the government putting barriers to people getting the drugs they need.	0
1058	SANDERS	I think that's a fair point.	0
1059	SANDERS	I think if you have a product that has been deemed safe by countries that have high standards in this area, I think you make a good point.	0
1060	SANDERS	But I think the more important point is that the government of the United States representing the American people has got to control the incredible greed of the pharmaceutical industry.	0
1061	SANDERS	Will you join me?	0
1062	SANDERS	I do appreciate you coming on board the re-importation.	0
1063	SANDERS	I really do.	0
1064	SANDERS	And we can win it if we got Republican support.	0
1065	SANDERS	Will you stand with me in saying that Medicare which spends a huge amount of money for prescription drugs should be able to negotiate prices?	0
1066	CRUZ	Oh, listen, of course, Medicare should negotiate.	0
1067	CRUZ	But you and I have a different view on how you control greed.	0
1068	SANDERS	Will you be on board that legislation?	0
1069	CRUZ	Hold on.	0
1070	CRUZ	Let me finish what I'm saying.	0
1071	CRUZ	Your view -- you said before that, gosh, these executives make too much money.	0
1072	CRUZ	I don't think the government should be in the business of deciding what you get paid and you get paid and you get paid.	0
1073	CRUZ	And there are socialist countries on earth.	0
1074	CRUZ	There are socialist countries that you encourage us to be like.	0
1075	CRUZ	But those countries are not doing nearly as well as America.	0
1076	CRUZ	You know, the per capita income in America is over five times the average per capita income in this world.	0
1077	CRUZ	It's 50 percent more than the per capita income in Europe.	0
1078	CRUZ	This is a land of opportunity because there is social mobility.	0
1079	CRUZ	In socialist countries, if you are born poor, you usually stay poor.	0
1080	CRUZ	The advantage of this country, someone can start out a dishwasher like my dad did and the free enterprise system in this country lets people rise.	0
1081	CRUZ	So, I don't think the answer is government putting wage and price controls in and deciding --	0
1082	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1083	BASH	Senator Sanders --	0
1084	SANDERS	The point was that millions of Americans can't afford the medicine while the drug companies are making incredible profits and paying their CEOs obscene compensation packages.	0
1085	SANDERS	Yes, that does concern me.	0
1086	SANDERS	In terms of socialist countries, you think Denmark and Sweden and Finland are terrible places to live.	0
1087	SANDERS	I think they do pretty well --	0
1088	CRUZ	I choose to live in America.	0
1089	BASH	Senator Sanders, let's get back to America and to the Affordable Care Act.	0
1090	BASH	Throughout your campaign, you said that taxes should go up on the	0
1091	BASH	rich, not the middle class.	0
1092	BASH	And yet, millions of Americans who chose not to get health care are forced to pay a tax penalty.	0
1093	BASH	So, families of four are paying up to $2,000 per year for failing to purchase coverage.	0
1094	BASH	Many say that they can't afford the premiums, so it's just cheaper for them to pay the penalty than get health care.	0
1095	BASH	So, is it fair to put this tax burden on families?	0
1096	SANDERS	No.	0
1097	SANDERS	It's not.	0
1098	SANDERS	But on the other hand, is it fair to not raise the revenue that we need to provide the kinds of benefits that we are providing?	0
1099	SANDERS	That is a way to do it.	0
1100	SANDERS	I don't think it's a particularly good way.	0
1101	SANDERS	I disagree with Ted, who wants to give, according to the "Wall Street Journal" and many other publications, incredible tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires.	0
1102	SANDERS	I think in the wealthiest country in the world, we should raise funds in a progressive way, where the very rich are now doing phenomenally well -- yes, I do believe they should be asked to pay more in taxes and I think we should use that money and other mechanisms to provide health care to all people.	0
1103	BASH	Senator, on that very topic, the top 1 percent are paying a lot more in taxes under Obamacare.	0
1104	BASH	But if you repeal it, will the top 1 percent, the wealthiest Americans effectively get a tax cut?	0
1105	CRUZ	Well, Dana, let me point out that Bernie acknowledged that 6.5 million Americans are paying Obamacare tax fines because they can't afford insurance.	0
1106	CRUZ	So, they can't afford health insurance and then the IRS comes in and fines them.	0
1107	CRUZ	He says, gosh, I don't agree with that.	0
1108	CRUZ	And yet, throughout the Democratic debate, Bernie says he helped write Obamacare that imposes these fines on people.	0
1109	CRUZ	I think it's wrong to be fining people.	0
1110	CRUZ	But let me make a broader point on taxes.	0
1111	CRUZ	Many times in this debate, Bernie has talked about providing health care for free from the government.	0
1112	CRUZ	You know what?	0
1113	CRUZ	The simplest principle in economics is TANSTAAFL, there ain't no such thing as a free lunch.	0
1114	CRUZ	The liberal-leaning Urban Institute scored Bernie's health plan, concluded it would cost $2.5 trillion in the first year and $32 trillion over ten years.	0
1115	CRUZ	Now, how much that is?	0
1116	CRUZ	Trillions, it's a big number.	0
1117	CRUZ	It's not clear what that is.	0
1118	CRUZ	Let me put it in perspective.	0
1119	CRUZ	All of the federal income taxes we pay today are about $1.5 trillion a year.	0
1120	CRUZ	$2.5 trillion means every one of us paying income taxes would have to about triple what you pay in income taxes to get an additional $2.5 trillion.	0
1121	CRUZ	Now, Bernie no doubt is going to come back and say, no, no, no, none of you are going to pay.	0
1122	CRUZ	Just the rich.	0
1123	CRUZ	Well, how about if we took every person that makes over $1 million a	0
1124	CRUZ	year and confiscated 100 percent of their income, took every penny that they make.	0
1125	CRUZ	That would raise only enough money to fund Bernie's plan for five months.	0
1126	CRUZ	Here's another idea.	0
1127	CRUZ	How about if the government confiscated the assets of Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and ExxonMobil, if it came in, illegally seized those companies and sold them, that would pay for one year of Bernie's plan.	0
1128	CRUZ	If you don't want to see your taxes triple in addition to the wait lists, in addition to the rationing, in addition to fewer MRIs and mammograms to worse care, then you don't want to see Bernie's Medicaid for all.	0
1129	CRUZ	You want to see cheap, affordable health care that you can choose that puts you in control.	0
1130	SANDERS	Quote, "Wall Street Journal", October 29th, 2015.	0
1131	SANDERS	Ted Cruz's -- Wall Street Journal," not my paper, your paper, maybe.	0
1132	CRUZ	Oh, no.	0
1133	SANDERS	Ted Cruz's new tax plan delivers its biggest benefits to the top 1 percent of U.S. households, adding about one-third to their after-tax income.	0
1134	SANDERS	Here is the economic reality facing America.	0
1135	SANDERS	In the last 35 years, there has been a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class and the working class to the top one-tenth of 1 percent.	0
1136	SANDERS	We are talking about trillions of dollars.	0
1137	SANDERS	Ted's response to that is he's going to support the repeal of the estate tax, correct?	0
1138	SANDERS	You're on record in doing that.	0
1139	CRUZ	Among many things.	0
1140	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1141	SANDERS	Among many other breaks to billionaires.	0
1142	CRUZ	I don't want to bankrupt small business owners.	0
1143	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1144	SANDERS	The only people who pay the estate tax are the top two- tenths of 1 percent.	0
1145	SANDERS	It would cost us over $200 billion.	0
1146	SANDERS	And as Ted said, it goes on and on and on.	0
1147	SANDERS	So, this right wing hyperbole of we can confiscate everybody -- it's not going to do anything.	0
1148	SANDERS	Here's the basic point: if we pass the Sanders plan, 95 percent of people in this country would have more after-tax income than they have right now.	0
1149	BASH	Senators, I'm sorry.	0
1150	BASH	It's clear we have a lot more to debate and we can do that at a later time but we have to take a break.	0
1151	BASH	And when we come back, closing statements about health carry.	0
1152	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1153	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
1154	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1155	TAPPER	Now it's time for closing statements.	0
1156	TAPPER	Each senator will get two minutes.	0
1157	TAPPER	We're going to begin with Senator Bernie Sanders.	0
1158	TAPPER	Senator?	0
1159	SANDERS	Well, let me thank Ted for being here.	0
1160	SANDERS	Let me thank CNN for sponsoring this debate which I thought has been a very interesting discussion.	0
1161	SANDERS	As I see it, the great political problem that we face right now is that we have a Congress that is more interested in representing their campaign contributors and the very wealthy than the needs of ordinary Americans.	0
1162	SANDERS	Ted ran a very vigorous campaign for president.	0
1163	SANDERS	I congratulate him.	0
1164	SANDERS	But Ted also received $36 million in their campaign from three billionaires, three billionaires.	0
1165	SANDERS	And as a result of Citizens United, we are now looking at the Koch brothers, the second wealthiest family in America, and other billionaires literally buying elections.	0
1166	SANDERS	And that translates into health care policy because the end result is that Congress worries more about the insurance industry and the pharmaceutical industry and the medical equipment suppliers than they do about the needs of the American people.	0
1167	SANDERS	If you listen closely to the very fine questions that people here asked tonight, and you take a step backward, you say whoa, what kind of craziness is this?	0
1168	SANDERS	We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world and yet we have tens and tens and tens of millions of people struggling with prescription drugs, struggling with basic health care.	0
1169	SANDERS	Yes, we can do better than that.	0
1170	SANDERS	And then on top of all of that, we end up spending almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country.	0
1171	SANDERS	Now, what Ted is proposing is to make a difficult situation even worse.	0
1172	SANDERS	To my mind, Obamacare is a step forward.	0
1173	SANDERS	We have got to go further.	0
1174	SANDERS	But what Ted wants to do is do away with many of the patient protection bills, provisions, that were passed, pre-existing conditions, a cap on what you have to pay, making sure that women are not discriminated against, making sure that young people can stay on their parents' insurance programs.	0
1175	SANDERS	Under Ted's idea, all of that is gone.	0
1176	SANDERS	You are on your own.	0
1177	SANDERS	I think that is a very bad idea.	0
1178	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
1179	TAPPER	Senator Cruz?	0
1180	CRUZ	I want to thank Bernie for being here and for being a vigorous and honest debater.	0
1181	CRUZ	He believes what he believes and he represents it well.	0
1182	CRUZ	And I want to thank each much you for spending so much time addressing this critically important issue.	0
1183	CRUZ	You know, I'd like to take a minute and ask the people if the cameras could turn for a moment to the folks in the audience, I want to ask you how many of you here in the last six years have seen your health insurance premiums or your deductibles go up?	0
1184	CRUZ	Let me ask another question.	0
1185	CRUZ	How many of you here know somebody including yourself who has had your insurance policy canceled in the last six years?	0
1186	CRUZ	If you look at these hands across the room, this is why people are so unhappy with Obamacare, because it isn't working, because it was built on an edifice of lies.	0
1187	CRUZ	When politicians promise the American people, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan, if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, and 6 million people get their plans canceled against their wishes, those are broken promises.	0
1188	CRUZ	When the president of the United States promises your premiums will drop $2,500 and instead, the average premium rises $5,000 and deductibles go up $5,000, people are hurting because of Obamacare.	0
1189	CRUZ	And Bernie's solution -- you know, I'm reminded of an old "Saturday Night Live" skit with Christopher Walken where they are playing in a band and he keeps ringing the cow bell.	0
1190	CRUZ	And every team they recorded his solution is more cow bell, more cow bell.	0
1191	CRUZ	It was government control that messed this all up.	0
1192	CRUZ	And Bernie and the Democrats' solution is more cow bell, more cow bell.	0
1193	CRUZ	Yes, it didn't work when we said you wouldn't get your plan canceled.	0
1194	CRUZ	Yes, it didn't work when we said your premiums would be cut.	0
1195	CRUZ	But give government even more power.	0
1196	CRUZ	We can do better.	0
1197	CRUZ	I believe we are going to honor the promises we made to the American people and we are going to repeal what Bill Clinton called Obamacare the craziest law in the world.	0
1198	CRUZ	Instead, we're going to give you choice, let you buy insurance across state lines, expand health savings accounts, make insurance portable, block grant Medicaid to the states so you can have experimentation, health savings accounts so we can meet your need, put you in charge of your health care with your doctor, not government.	0
1199	CRUZ	That's what this election was about, and now, it is incumbent on all of us, Republicans and Democrats, to deliver on the promises made to the American people.	0
1200	TAPPER	Our thanks to Senator Cruz and Senator Sanders for joining us here tonight.	0
1201	BASH	And we also want to thank our audience here, our hosts at my alma mater, the George Washington University.	0
