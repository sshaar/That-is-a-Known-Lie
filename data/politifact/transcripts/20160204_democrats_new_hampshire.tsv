1	TODD	Good evening, and welcome to the MSNBC Democratic candidates debate.	0
2	MADDOW	We are super excited to be here at the University of New Hampshire.	0
3	MADDOW	Tonight, this is the first time that Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have squared off exactly like this.	0
4	MADDOW	Face-to-face, just one-on-one, just the two of them.	0
5	TODD	And neither party has seen this yet.	0
6	TODD	These candidates are both running for the Democratic nomination, but they are very different from each other when it comes to what matters most and how they would go about the job of being president.	0
7	TODD	Our job tonight is to draw out those differences so you, the voters, can understand them and be fully informed.	0
8	MADDOW	And we do hope that the candidates will take this opportunity to show us the distinctions—show us the differences between them.	0
9	MADDOW	That's the whole reason that we're here tonight.	0
10	MADDOW	We're not here for talking points.	0
11	MADDOW	We're to learn about the difference between the candidates.	0
12	MADDOW	And with that, let's get going.	0
13	MADDOW	Please join us in welcoming Secretary Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders.	0
14	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
15	TODD	First, I want to say a special thanks to the New Hampshire Union Leader for helping make this debate possible, and the readers, who helped provide some of the questions and topics that we'll be addressing tonight.	0
16	TODD	The rules tonight, by the way, are simple: 90 seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals.	0
17	MADDOW	And with that, that's it.	0
18	MADDOW	We're going to begin with 60- second opening statements from each of the candidates.	0
19	MADDOW	And as agreed to in advance by the two campaigns, we're going to begin tonight with Senator Sanders.	0
20	SANDERS	Rachel, thank you very much.	0
21	SANDERS	Millions of Americans are giving up on the political process.	0
22	SANDERS	And they're giving up on the political process because they understand the economy is rigged.	0
23	SANDERS	They are working longer hours for low wages.	0
24	SANDERS	They're worried about the future of their kids, and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent.	1
25	SANDERS	Not what America is supposed to be about.	0
26	SANDERS	Not the fairness that we grew up believing that America was about.	0
27	SANDERS	And then sustaining that rigged economy is a corrupt campaign finance system undermining American democracy, where billionaire, Wall Street, corporate America can contribute unlimited sums of money into super PACs and into candidates.	0
28	SANDERS	Our job, together, is to end a rigged economy, create an economy that works for all, and absolutely overturn Citizens United.	0
29	SANDERS	One person, one vote.	0
30	SANDERS	That's what American democracy is about.	0
31	TODD	Thank you, Senator.	0
32	TODD	Secretary Clinton.	0
33	CLINTON	Well, I'm happy to be here in New Hampshire for this debate, as we move toward the primary on Tuesday.	0
34	CLINTON	I believe that America has the opportunity to once again live by our values, live up to our values in the 21st century, but I think that America can only do that if Americans can succeed.	0
35	CLINTON	And there are lots of reasons why Americans today are feeling left out and left behind.	0
36	CLINTON	Yes, of course, the economy has not been working for most Americans.	0
37	CLINTON	Yes, of course, we have special interests that are unfortunately doing too much to rig the game.	0
38	CLINTON	But there's also the continuing challenges of racism, of sexism, of discrimination against the LGBT community, of the way that we treat people as opposed to how we want to be treated.	0
39	CLINTON	I believe that we can get back on the right track.	0
40	CLINTON	I want to imagine a country where people's wages reflect their hard work, where we have healthcare for everyone, and where every child gets to live up to his or her potential.	0
41	CLINTON	I'm fighting for people who cannot wait for those changes, and I'm not making promises that I cannot keep.	0
42	TODD	All right.	0
43	TODD	Let's get started.	0
44	TODD	Secretary Clinton, last night you cited the Concord Monitor when you said of Senator Sanders that, quote, "It's very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable."	0
45	TODD	So please tell us why you think if he's elected president on a platform of promising things like free public college and universal healthcare, that he cannot achieve those things.	0
46	CLINTON	Well, let me start by saying that Senator Sanders and I share some very big progressive goals.	0
47	CLINTON	I've been fighting for universal healthcare for many years, and we're now on the path to achieving it.	0
48	CLINTON	I don't want us to start over again.	0
49	CLINTON	I think that would be a great mistake, to once again plunge our country into a contentious debate about whether we should have and what kind of system we should have for healthcare.	0
50	CLINTON	I want to build on the progress we've made; got from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent coverage.	0
51	CLINTON	And I don't want to rip away the security that people finally have; 18 million people now have healthcare; preexisting conditions are no longer a bar.	0
52	CLINTON	So we have a difference.	0
53	CLINTON	I also believe in affordable college, but I don't believe in free college, because every expert that I have talked to says, look, how will you ever control the costs.	0
54	CLINTON	What I want to do is make sure middle class kids, not Donald Trump's kids, get to be able to afford college.	0
55	CLINTON	I want to get the economy going again.	0
56	CLINTON	It's not just enough about what we're against, as important as that is.	0
57	CLINTON	I have a plan to create new jobs, manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy jobs that will make us the 21st century clean energy super power.	0
58	CLINTON	I also want to make sure small businesses can start and grow again.	0
59	CLINTON	And of course, I believe in raising the minimum wage and equal pay for work.	0
60	CLINTON	But the numbers just don't add up, from what Senator Sanders has been proposing.	0
61	CLINTON	That's why all of the independent experts, all of the editorial boards that have vetted both of us have concluded that it is just not achievable.	0
62	CLINTON	Let's go down a path where we can actually tell people what we will do.	0
63	CLINTON	A progressive is someone who makes progress.	0
64	CLINTON	That's what I intend to do.	0
65	TODD	Thank you, Secretary.	0
66	TODD	Senator Sanders, so just explain how you spent nearly two decades in Congress and haven't gotten any of these things passed.	0
67	TODD	Why do you think as president you'll be able to achieve big, big new programs like this?	0
68	SANDERS	Well, I haven't quite run for president before.	0
69	SYSTEM	[ laughter and applause ]	0
70	SANDERS	Let's deal with some of the comments that Secretary Clinton made.	0
71	SANDERS	And by the way, you know, sometimes there's a lot of drama here.	0
72	SANDERS	I have known Secretary Clinton for 25 years and respect her very much.	0
73	SANDERS	Here is the issue.	0
74	SANDERS	Every major country on earth, whether it's the U.K., whether it's France, whether it's Canada, has managed to provide healthcare to all people as a right and they are spending significantly less per capita on health care than we are.	0
75	SANDERS	So I do not accept the belief that the United States of America can't do that.	0
76	SANDERS	I do not accept the belief that the United States of America and our government can't stand up to the ripoffs of the pharmaceutical industry which charge us by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.	0
77	SANDERS	Number two, in the economy today, everybody understands that we need a well educated workforce.	0
78	SANDERS	This is 2016.	0
79	SANDERS	When we talk about public education, it can no longer be K through 12th grade.	0
80	SANDERS	I do believe that public colleges and universities should be tuition free.	0
81	SANDERS	Well, how do we pay for that?	0
82	SANDERS	It's an expensive proposition.	0
83	SANDERS	I do believe that we should substantially lower student debt in this country, which is crushing millions of people.	0
84	SANDERS	We pay for it, in my view, by a tax on Wall Street speculation.	0
85	SANDERS	The middle class bailed out Wall Street in their time of need.	0
86	SANDERS	Now, it is Wall Street's time to help the middle class.	0
87	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
88	CLINTON	If I could just follow up on that.	0
89	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
90	CLINTON	There is no disagreement between us on universal coverage for health care, the disagreement is where do we start from and where do we end up.	0
91	CLINTON	The Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I want to improve it.	0
92	CLINTON	I want to build on it, get the costs down, get prescription drug costs down.	0
93	CLINTON	Senator Sanders wants us to start all over again.	0
94	CLINTON	This was a major achievement of President Obama, of our country.	0
95	CLINTON	It is helping people right now.	0
96	CLINTON	I am not going to wait and have us plunge back into a contentious national debate that has very little chance of succeeding.	0
97	CLINTON	Let's make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody.	0
98	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
99	SANDERS	Let me...	0
100	TODD	Go.	0
101	SANDERS	... this is a good discussion here.	0
102	TODD	Yes, go ahead.	0
103	SANDERS	And let me just say this.	0
104	SANDERS	As Secretary Clinton may know, I am on the Health Education Labor Committee.	0
105	SANDERS	That committee wrote the Affordable Care Act.	0
106	SANDERS	The idea I would dismantle health care in America while we're waiting to pass a Medicare for all is just not accurate.	0
107	SANDERS	The Affordable Care Act has clearly, as Secretary Clinton made the point, done a lot of good things, but, what it has not done is dealt with the fact we have 29 million people today who have zero health insurance, we have even more who are underinsured with large deductibles and copayments and prescription drug prices are off the wall.	0
108	SANDERS	So I do believe that in the future, not by dismantling what we have here—I helped write that bill—but by moving forward, rallying the American people, I do believe we should have health care for all.	0
109	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
110	TODD	All right, thank you both.	0
111	TODD	Rachel.	0
112	MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders is campaigning against you now, at this point in the campaign, basically arguing that you are not progressive enough to be the Democratic nominee.	0
113	MADDOW	He has said that if you voted for the Iraq war, if you are in favor of the death penalty, if you wobbled on things like the Keystone Pipeline or TPP, if you said single payer health care could never happen, then you're too far to the right of the Democratic Party to be the party's standard bearer.	0
114	MADDOW	Given those policy positions, why should liberal Democrats support you and not Senator Sanders?	0
115	CLINTON	Well because I am a progressive who gets things done.	0
116	CLINTON	And the root of that word, progressive, is progress.	0
117	CLINTON	But I've heard Senator Sanders comments, and it's really caused me to wonder who's left in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.	0
118	CLINTON	Under his definition, President Obama is not progressive because he took donations from Wall Street; Vice President Biden is not progressive because she supported Keystone; Senator Shaheen is not progressive because she supports the trade pact.	0
119	CLINTON	Even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not fit this definition because he voted for DOMA.	0
120	CLINTON	You know, we have differences and, honestly, I think we should be talk about what we want to do for the country.	0
121	CLINTON	But if we're going to get into labels, I don't think it was particularly progressive to vote against the Brady Bill five times.	0
122	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
123	CLINTON	I don't think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity.	0
124	CLINTON	I don't think it was progressive to vote against Ted Kennedy's immigration reform.	0
125	CLINTON	So we could go back and forth like this, but the fact is most people watching tonight want to know what we've done and what we will do.	0
126	CLINTON	That's why I am laying out a specific agenda that will make more progress, get more jobs with rising incomes, get us to universal health care coverage, get us to universal pre-k, paid family leave and the other elements of what I think will build a strong economy, that will ensure Americans keep making progress.	0
127	CLINTON	That's what I'm offering and that's what I will do as president.	0
128	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
129	MADDOW	Senator Sanders, have you established a list of what it means to be a progressive that is unrealistic?	0
130	SANDERS	No, not at all.	0
131	SANDERS	Here's the reality of American economic life today.	0
132	SANDERS	The reality is that we have one of lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth because so many people have given up on the political process.	0
133	SANDERS	The reality is that there has been trillions of dollars of wealth going from the middle class in the last 30 years to the top 1/10th of 1 percent.	0
134	SANDERS	The reality is we that have a corrupt campaign finance system which separates the American people's needs and desires from what Congress is doing.	0
135	SANDERS	So to my mind, what we have got to do is wage a political revolution where millions of people have given up on the political process, stand up and fight back, demand the government that represents us and not just a handful of campaign contribution—contributors.	0
136	SANDERS	Now all of the ideas that I'm talking about, they are not radical ideas.	0
137	SANDERS	Making public colleges and universities tuition free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States.	0
138	SANDERS	Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and creating 13 million jobs by doing away with tax loopholes that large corporations now enjoy by putting their money into the Cayman Islands and other tax havens.	0
139	SANDERS	That is not a radical idea.	0
140	SANDERS	What we need to do is to stand up to the big money interests, and the campaign contributors.	0
141	SANDERS	When we do that, we can, in fact, transform America.	0
142	MADDOW	Thank you Senator.	0
143	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
144	TODD	I'd like to follow up on a comment that Secretary Clinton said, Senator.	0
145	TODD	President Obama has not called for abolishing the death penalty.	0
146	TODD	President Obama is for the big Asian trade deal known as TPP, and just yesterday you said you can't be both a moderate or a progressive, but you can't be both.	0
147	TODD	Is President Obama, in your judgment, based on these policies positions, a progressive?	0
148	SANDERS	Let me just pick up on this point.	0
149	SANDERS	This whole discussion began because I commented, not making overall evaluation about the Secretary.	0
150	SANDERS	She was in Ohio, I think, in September or November and she got up and said something like, I have been—I'm paraphrasing, I have been criticized because people think I'm a moderate.	0
151	SANDERS	Well, I am a moderate.	0
152	SANDERS	That's where this came from.	0
153	SANDERS	It wasn't me paraphrasing her.	0
154	SANDERS	It is what she said, and all that I said was there's nothing wrong with being a moderate.	0
155	SANDERS	But, you can't be a moderate, you can't a progressive.	0
156	SANDERS	In terms of President Obama, I think if we remember where this country was seven years ago, 800,000 jobs being lost every month, $1.4 trillion dollar deficit.	0
157	SANDERS	The world's financial system on the verge of collapse.	0
158	SANDERS	I think that President Obama, Vice President Biden, and the Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate have done a fantastic job.	0
159	SANDERS	We are in much better shape than we were seven years ago, although my Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten where we were seven years ago.	0
160	SANDERS	That's the fact, but, we still have a very long way to go.	0
161	SANDERS	Do I think President Obama is a progressive?	0
162	SANDERS	Yes, I do.	0
163	SANDERS	I disagree with him on a number of issues including the trade agreement.	0
164	SANDERS	But, yes, I think he has done an excellent job.	0
165	CLINTON	Well, Chuck...	0
166	TODD	...Secretary Clinton, go ahead...	0
167	CLINTON	...	0
168	CLINTON	If I could, you know, in the very first debate I was asked am I a moderate or a progressive and I said I'm a progressive who likes to get things done.	0
169	CLINTON	Cherry picking a quote here or there doesn't change my record of having fought for racial justice, having fought for kids rights, having fought the kind of inequities that fueled my interest in service in the first place going back to my days in the Children's Defense Fund.	0
170	CLINTON	It certainly didn't stop me from taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies.	0
171	CLINTON	Before it was called Hillarycare—I mean, before it was called ObamaCare it was called Hillarycare because we took them on, and we weren't successful, but we kept fighting and we got the children's health insurance program.	0
172	CLINTON	Every step along the way I have stood up, and fought, and have the scars to prove it.	0
173	CLINTON	So, again...	0
174	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
175	CLINTON	...I think it's important that, look, I understand Senator Sanders really trying to distinguish himself.	0
176	CLINTON	I understand that, that's what you do in campaigns, but at the same time let's not be—in, I think an unfair way, making an accusation, or making an attack about where I stand and about where I've always stood.	0
177	CLINTON	It is fair to say, Senator, that in your definition, as you being the self-proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism, I don't know anyone else who fits that definition, but I know a lot of really hard fighting progressives in the Democratic party who have stood up time, and time again against special interests, against the powerful on behalf of those who are left behind and left out.	0
178	CLINTON	And, that's what we ought to be celebrating.	0
179	CLINTON	Let's talk about what we would do as President, and Commander in Chief to make sure the progress continues into the future.	0
180	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
181	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]	0
182	TODD	30 seconds, and then we'll move.	0
183	SANDERS	That's right, I mean, instead of arguing about definitions, let's talk about...	0
184	CLINTON	... Well, you began it yesterday with your comments...	0
185	SANDERS	... What we should do, and one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk, but walk the walk.	0
186	SANDERS	I am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does not have a Super PAC, who's not raising huge sums of money from Wall Street...	0
187	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
188	SANDERS	... And special interests.	0
189	SANDERS	I am enormously proud.	0
190	SANDERS	Never believed it would happen that we have raised 3.5 million individual contributions, averaging $27 dollars a piece.	0
191	SANDERS	That is what the political revolution means.	0
192	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
193	TODD	Thank you.	0
194	MADDOW	Senator Sanders, as a Vermonter, you have almost a home state advantage here in New Hampshire.	0
195	MADDOW	But back home across the border, you also have a long history of running against Democrats as a third-party candidate, for governor, Senate, for Congress.	0
196	MADDOW	In 1988 your candidacy as a third-party candidate arguably cost the Democrats a congressional seat and sent a Republican instead.	0
197	MADDOW	How can you lead the Democratic Party nationally when you have not been a member of the Democratic Party until very recently?	0
198	SANDERS	Well, Rachel, actually, that wasn't accurate.	0
199	SANDERS	In 1988 the Republican did win, I believe, by 3 points.	0
200	SANDERS	I came in second.	0
201	SANDERS	It was 34-31, I think, 19 for the Democrat.	0
202	SANDERS	In that race the Democrat was the spoiler, not me.	0
203	SANDERS	And it is true...	0
204	SYSTEM	[ laughter and applause ]	0
205	SANDERS	...it is true, it's not to be denied, I am the longest- serving independent in the history of the United States Congress.	0
206	SANDERS	People of Vermont sent me to Washington as an independent.	0
207	SANDERS	That is true.	0
208	SANDERS	But on the other hand, I have—when I was in the House for 16 years, I caucused with the Democrats.	0
209	SANDERS	In the Senate for nine years caucused with the Democrats, of course.	0
210	SANDERS	And I was elected by the Democrats to be chair of the Veterans Committee three years ago, which I'm very proud of.	0
211	SANDERS	And now am the rankings member on the Budget Committee, leader of the Democrats in opposition to the majority Republicans.	0
212	SANDERS	I am running for president as a Democrat.	0
213	SANDERS	And if elected, not only do I hope to bring forth a major change in national priorities, but let me be frank, I do want to see major changes in the Democratic Party.	0
214	SANDERS	I want to see working people and young people come into the party in a way that doesn't exist now.	0
215	SANDERS	And you know what, I want a 50-state strategy so the Democratic Party is not just the party of 25 states.	0
216	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
217	MADDOW	Secretary Clinton.	0
218	CLINTON	You know, the person who first put out the idea of a 50-state party strategy is former Governor Howard Dean, who is with us tonight.	0
219	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
220	CLINTON	And I'm very proud and grateful to have the support of so many elected Vermonters and former officials.	0
221	CLINTON	Two former governors, the current governor, the current other senator.	0
222	CLINTON	I really appreciate that.	0
223	CLINTON	And I think it's because they've worked with me, they've seen what I do.	0
224	CLINTON	They know what kind of a colleague I am.	0
225	CLINTON	They want me as their partner in the White House.	0
226	CLINTON	And that's exactly what I will do.	0
227	CLINTON	We'll get things done together.	0
228	CLINTON	Democrats, Republicans, independents, we're going to make progress together when I'm president.	0
229	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
230	MADDOW	So, Senator, to that point, Secretary Clinton is raising the issue of endorsements by your home state Democrats.	0
231	MADDOW	She's implying that that says something about the people who know you best.	0
232	SANDERS	Well, I don't see it quite like that.	0
233	MADDOW	How do you see it?	0
234	SANDERS	I am—will absolutely admit that Secretary Clinton has the support of far more governors, mayors, members of the House.	0
235	SANDERS	She has the entire establishment or almost the entire establishment behind her.	0
236	SANDERS	That's a fact.	0
237	SANDERS	I don't deny it.	0
238	SANDERS	But I am pretty proud that we have over a million people who have contributed to our campaign averaging 27 bucks apiece.	0
239	SANDERS	That we have had meetings where 25,000-30,000 people have come out.	0
240	SANDERS	That our campaign is a campaign of the people, by the people, and for the people.	0
241	SANDERS	So, Rachel, yes, Secretary Clinton does represent the establishment.	0
242	SANDERS	I represent, I hope, ordinary Americans, and by the way, who are not all that enamored with the establishment, but I am very proud to have people like Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva in the House, the co-chairmen of the House Progressive Caucus.	0
243	MADDOW	Secretary.	0
244	CLINTON	Well, look, I've got to just jump in here because, honestly, Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment.	0
245	CLINTON	And I've got to tell you that it is...	0
246	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
247	CLINTON	...it is really quite amusing to me.	0
248	CLINTON	People support me because they know me.	0
249	CLINTON	They know my life's work.	0
250	CLINTON	They have worked with me and many have also worked with Senator Sanders.	0
251	CLINTON	And at the end of the day they endorse me because they know I can get things done.	0
252	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
253	CLINTON	I am not going to make promises I can't keep.	0
254	CLINTON	I am not going to talk about big ideas like single-payer and then not level with people about how much it will cost.	0
255	CLINTON	A respected health economist said that these plans would cost a trillion dollars more a year.	0
256	CLINTON	I'm not going to tell people that I will raise your incomes and not your taxes, and not mean it, because I don't want to see the kind of struggle that the middle class is going through exemplified by these promises that would raise taxes and make it much more difficult for many, many Americans to get ahead and stay ahead.	0
257	CLINTON	That is not my agenda.	0
258	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
259	MADDOW	Senator Sanders, you'll have 30 seconds to respond to that.	0
260	SANDERS	What being part of the establishment is, is, in the last quarter, having a super PAC that raised $15 million from Wall Street, that throughout one's life raised a whole lot of money from the drug companies and other special interests.	0
261	SANDERS	To my mind, if we do not get a handle on money in politics and the degree to which big money controls the political process in this country, nobody is going to bring about the changes that is needed in this country for the middle class and working families.	0
262	CLINTON	Yeah, but I—I think it's fair to really ask what's behind that comment.	0
263	CLINTON	You know, Senator Sanders has said he wants to run a positive campaign.	0
264	CLINTON	I've tried to keep my disagreements over issues, as it should be.	0
265	CLINTON	But time and time again, by innuendo, by insinuation, there is this attack that he is putting forth, which really comes down to—you know, anybody who ever took donations or speaking fees from any interest group has to be bought.	0
266	CLINTON	And I just absolutely reject that, Senator.	0
267	CLINTON	And I really don't think these kinds of attacks by insinuation are worthy of you.	0
268	CLINTON	And enough is enough.	0
269	CLINTON	If you've got something to say, say it directly.	0
270	CLINTON	But you will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received.	0
271	SANDERS	What...	0
272	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
273	CLINTON	And I have stood up and I have represented my constituents to the best of my abilities, and I'm very proud of that.	0
274	SANDERS	... you know...	0

281	CLINTON	...let's talk about about the issues.	0
282	CLINTON	Let's talk about the issues that divide us.	0
283	SANDERS	Let's talk about—OK, let's talk...	0
284	CLINTON	And let's—let's...	0
285	SANDERS	... let us talk about issues.	0
286	CLINTON	... we both agree with campaign finance reform.	0
287	SANDERS	Let's talk about issues.	0
288	CLINTON	I—I worked hard for McCain-Feingold.	0
289	SANDERS	Let's...	0
290	CLINTON	I want to reverse Citizens United.	0
291	SANDERS	... let's—let's—let's talk about issues.	0
292	CLINTON	And so—let's talk about issues.	0
293	SANDERS	Let's talk—let's talk about issues, all right?	0
294	SANDERS	Let's talk about why, in the 1990s, Wall Street got deregulated.	0
295	SANDERS	Did it have anything to do with the fact that Wall Street provided—spent billions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions?	0
296	SANDERS	Well, some people might think, yeah, that had some influence.	0
297	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
298	SANDERS	Let's ask why it is that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, and your medicine can be doubled tomorrow, and there's nothing that the government can do to stop it.	0
299	SANDERS	You think it has anything to do with the huge amounts of campaign contributions and lobbying from the fossil fuel industry?	0
300	SANDERS	Let's talk about climate change.	0
301	SANDERS	Do you think there's a reason why not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real, and that we need to transform our energy system?	0
302	SANDERS	Do you think it has anything to do with the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil pouring huge amounts of money into the political system?	0
303	SANDERS	That is what goes on in America.	0
304	SANDERS	I am not—I like...	0
305	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
306	SANDERS	...there is a reason.	0
307	SANDERS	You know, there is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system.	0
308	SANDERS	And in my view, it is undermining American democracy and it is allowing Congress to represent wealthy campaign contributors and not the working families of this country.	0
309	CLINTON	Well, you know, Senator, I don't think—I don't...	0

313	TODD	... Secretary, we're gonna...	0
314	CLINTON	...	0
315	CLINTON	I don't think you could find any person in political life today who has been subjected to more attacks and had more money spent against her by special interests, among whom you have named a few, than I.	0
316	CLINTON	And I'm proud of that.	0
317	CLINTON	You know, when I took on the drug companies and the insurance companies for universal health care coverage, they went after me with a vengeance.	0
318	CLINTON	Today, you've got hedge fund billionaires aligned with Karl Rove, running ads against me to try to get Democrats to vote for you.	0
319	CLINTON	I know this game.	0
320	CLINTON	I'm going to stop this game.	0
321	CLINTON	But while we're talking about votes, you're the one who voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives in 2000, which contributed to the over-leveraging of Lehman Brothers, which was one of the culprits that brought down the economy.	0
322	CLINTON	So I don't know—I'm not impugning your motive because you voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives.	0
323	CLINTON	People make mistakes and I'm certainly not saying you did it for any kind of financial advantage.	0
324	CLINTON	What we've got to do as Democrats—what we've got to do as Democrats is to be united to actually solve these problems.	0
325	CLINTON	And what I believe is that I have a better track record and a better opportunity to actually get that job done.	0
326	CLINTON	That's what this election should be about.	0

332	SANDERS	I think as Secretary Clinton knows, there is nobody who fought harder.	0
333	SANDERS	I was on the House Financial Committee at that time.	0
334	SANDERS	I heard the arguments coming from Democrats and Republicans—Robert Rubin, Alan Greenspan—about great an idea it would be if we did away with Glass-Steagall and if we allowed investor banks and commercial banks and big insurance companies to merge.	0
335	SANDERS	Go to YouTube today.	0
336	SANDERS	Look up Greenspan-Sanders.	0
337	SANDERS	Listen to what I told them then.	0
338	SANDERS	I helped lead the effort against deregulation.	0
339	SANDERS	Unfortunately, we lost that.	0
340	SANDERS	The result is—was the worst financial disaster since the Great Depression.	0
341	TODD	Thank you both.	0
342	MADDOW	Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton, obviously we've touched a nerve.	0
343	MADDOW	We're going to be back with more on this subject, and much more, right after this.	0
344	MADDOW	Stay with us.	0
345	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
346	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]	0
347	TODD	All right, welcome back.	0
348	TODD	Let's get right to it.	0
349	TODD	Senator Sanders, you were talking about all of your campaign contributions and campaign finance reform.	0
350	TODD	You rail against big money in politics.	0
351	TODD	But do you realize there is one public financing system that we do have in place, and it is—it is in place to run for president.	0
352	TODD	Why aren't you walking the walk on that?	0
353	TODD	Why aren't you participating in the presidential public financing system which is designed to essentially keep big money out of presidential politics?	0
354	SANDERS	Chuck, actually we looked at it, but it turns out to be a disaster.	0
355	SANDERS	The way it is structured right now, if you make it all the way to California, you could do pretty well.	0
356	SANDERS	But in terms of the early states—Iowa, New Hampshire, the other states—it just doesn't work.	0
357	SANDERS	Your point is well taken.	0
358	SANDERS	I believe in public funding of elections, absolutely.	0
359	SANDERS	But this system is—I don't know if the secretary would agree—is currently very antiquated and no longer applies to modern day politics.	0
360	TODD	Well, going on that then, why criticize her on Super PACs, and you got—and all this when it is—you know, that's the system?	0
361	TODD	I mean, you could be participating in a publicly-financing—public financing system...	0
362	SANDERS	But if the...	0
363	TODD	... and being able to set—being able to set an example.	0
364	SANDERS	—but Chuck, it is a public financing system that everybody knows is antiquated.	0
365	SANDERS	It no longer works.	0
366	SANDERS	Nobody can become president based on that system.	0
367	SANDERS	So what's the alternative?	0
368	SANDERS	There are two alternatives.	0
369	SANDERS	And, you know, we looked at it.	0
370	SANDERS	Well, should we do a Super PAC, but I concluded, honestly, I don't represent Corporate America or billionaires, I didn't want it.	0
371	SANDERS	So the other alternative was to ask working families and the middle class to help out in a transformational campaign.	0
372	SANDERS	And you know what?	0
373	SANDERS	We got 3.5 million individual contributions, $27 a piece.	0
374	SANDERS	I think that's pretty good.	0
375	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
376	MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, on the issue of Wall Street...	0
377	CLINTON	On the issue of Wall Street.	0
378	MADDOW	... on the issue of Wall Street, when our reporters go out and talk to people on the ground in the early states, what they tell us over and over again when they find voters who are leaning toward Senator Sanders rather than yourself is that the most frequent area of concern that they hear from those voters is the issue of Wall Street and whether or not you are too close to Wall Street.	0
379	MADDOW	Last night, when you were asked about speaking fees and the amount of speaking fees you got from Goldman Sachs speeches, you said that's what they offered.	0
380	MADDOW	Have you been too dismissive of voters' concerns about this issue in your own campaign and your own career?	0
381	CLINTON	Well you know, Rachel, I think I may not have done the job I should in explaining my record.	0
382	CLINTON	You know, I did—when I left the secretary of State's office, like so many former officials, military leaders, journalists, others, I did go on the speaking circuit.	0
383	CLINTON	I spoke to heart doctors, I spoke to the American Camping Association, I spoke to auto dealers, and yes, I spoke to firms on Wall Street.	0
384	CLINTON	They wanted me to talk about the world, what my experience had been as secretary of State.	0
385	CLINTON	But what I want people to know is I went to Wall Street before the crash.	0
386	CLINTON	I was the one saying you're going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages.	0
387	CLINTON	I called to end the carried interest loophole that hedge fund managers enjoy.	0
388	CLINTON	I proposed changes in CEO compensation.	0
389	CLINTON	I called for a consumer protection financial bureau before it was created.	0
390	CLINTON	And I think the best evidence that the Wall Street people at least know where I stand and where I have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary.	0
391	CLINTON	They have collected and spent as much as $6 million on these ads.	0
392	CLINTON	Hedge fund billionaires, Karl Rove, another billionaire, jumped in.	0
393	CLINTON	And why are they doing that?	0
394	CLINTON	These are guys who try to make smart investments.	0
395	CLINTON	They know my record, they know me, they know that I say what I believe and I will do it.	0
396	CLINTON	And I also have a pretty good understanding about how to stop them.	0
397	CLINTON	So I do want people to know that, and I think it's important for everybody to understand I have a record, I have stood firm and I will be the person who prevents them from ever wrecking the economy again.	0
398	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
399	MADDOW	Senator Sanders, you have been a critic of Secretary Clinton taking those speaking fees and having donations from Wall Street.	0
400	MADDOW	What about her defense of her record?	0
401	SANDERS	Let me just say this.	0
402	SANDERS	Wall Street is perhaps the most powerful economic and political force in this country.	0
403	SANDERS	You have companies like Goldman Sachs, who just recently paid a settlement fine with the federal government for $5 billion for defrauding investors.	0
404	SANDERS	Goldman Sachs was one of those companies whose illegal activity helped destroy our economy and ruin the lives of millions of Americans.	0
405	SANDERS	But this is what a rigged economy and a corrupt campaign finance system and a broken criminal justice is about.	0
406	SANDERS	These guys are so powerful that not one of the executives on Wall Street has been charged with anything after paying, in this case of Goldman Sachs, a $5 billion fine.	0
407	SANDERS	Kid gets caught with marijuana, that kid has a police record.	0
408	SANDERS	A Wall Street executive destroys the economy, $5 billion settlement with the government, no criminal record.	0
409	SANDERS	That is what power is about.	0
410	SANDERS	That is what corruption is about.	0
411	SANDERS	And that is what has to change in the United States of America.	0
412	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
413	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]	0
414	CLINTON	If I could, let me just say that of course it has to change.	0
415	CLINTON	It has to change.	0
416	CLINTON	And that's why I have put forward a plan to do just that.	0
417	CLINTON	And it's been judged to be the toughest, most effective and comprehensive one.	0
418	CLINTON	I have great respect for Senator Sanders's commitment to try to restore Glass-Steagall.	0
419	CLINTON	But I do not believe that that is enough.	0
420	CLINTON	And in fact, I don't believe it really addresses a lot of the biggest issues we have.	0
421	CLINTON	You know, we now have power under the Dodd-Frank legislation to break up banks.	0
422	CLINTON	And I've said I will use that power if they pose a systemic risk.	0
423	CLINTON	But I want to go further, because it was investment banks, it was insurance companies, it was mortgage companies, all of which contributed.	0
424	CLINTON	So let's not just be narrowly focused on one part of the problem.	0
425	CLINTON	We have a lot of issues with corporate power that have to be addressed.	0
426	CLINTON	My plan takes us further and it would do the job.	0
427	CLINTON	[	0
428	CLINTON	crosstalk ]	0
429	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
430	SANDERS	I would say that—that folks who have looked at this issue for a long time, whether it's Elizabeth Warren or many other economists, will tell you that right now, yes, we do need a 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation.	0
431	SANDERS	And I would tell you also that when you have three out of the four largest banks in America today, bigger than they were—significantly bigger than when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, a good Republican by the way, what he would say is: Break them up; they are too powerful economically; they are too powerful politically.	0
432	SANDERS	And that is what I believe and many economists believe.	0
433	SANDERS	Time to break them up.	0
434	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
435	CLINTON	Look we have a law—look, you know, I—I appreciate the senator's advocacy.	0
436	CLINTON	We have a law.	0
437	CLINTON	It was passed.	0
438	CLINTON	It was signed by President Obama.	0
439	CLINTON	It lays out a process that you go through to determine whether a systemic risk is posed.	0
440	CLINTON	And by the way, President Obama signed that, pushed it through, even though he took donations from Wall Street, because he's a responsible president.	0
441	CLINTON	So we have a law in place.	0
442	CLINTON	If the circumstances warrant it, I will certainly use it.	0
443	CLINTON	And from what you say, I know you will as well.	0
444	CLINTON	But that is not enough.	0
445	CLINTON	And I keep going back to this because part of the reason the Wall Street guys are trying so hard to stop me—the hedge fund guys, the shadow banking guys—is because I've got their number on all of that.	0
446	CLINTON	And my plan goes so much further to try to prevent the problems of the future.	0
447	CLINTON	You know, we can't just fight the last war.	0
448	CLINTON	We've got to be prepared to stop these guys if they ever try to use their economic power once again, to hurt the economy, and to hurt so many Americans.	0
449	CLINTON	And my plan, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, a lot of experts who understand what the new challenges might be, have said I am exactly on point, and the Wall Street guys actually know that.	0
450	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
451	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]	0
452	TODD	... she has had more people praise her plan than yours.	0
453	SANDERS	Well, we've had a number of economists supporting our legislation.	0
454	SANDERS	And here's where we are.	0
455	SANDERS	The American people can judge.	0
456	SANDERS	Six largest financial institutions in America today have assets of roughly $10 trillion; equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of the United States of America.	0
457	SANDERS	That is a lot of money.	0
458	SANDERS	They issue two thirds of the credit cards, and by the way they're ripping off a whole lot of people with high interest rates on the credit cards, and they write about one third of the mortgages.	0
459	SANDERS	That is a lot of power for six financial institutions.	0
460	SANDERS	That's it.	0
461	SANDERS	I think it is too much power.	0
462	SANDERS	Too much economic power, too much political power, and the economists that I talk to say we should break them up.	0
463	TODD	Thank you both.	0
464	TODD	Let me move on to our next question here, and in fact it comes to us through New England Cable News.	0
465	TODD	Secretary Clinton, it's addressed to you, and it's about this issue of the speeches, particularly to Goldman Sachs.	0
466	TODD	This is what the questioner wrote verbatim.	0
467	TODD	I am concerned with the abuses of Wall Street has taken with the American taxpayers money, and then she asks whether you would release the transcripts of your Goldman Sachs speeches, and then added, "Don't you think the voting public has a right to know what was said?"	0
468	TODD	But, let's make that bigger.	0
469	TODD	Are you willing to release the transcripts of all your paid speeches?	0
470	TODD	We do know through reporting that there were transcription services for all of those paid speeches.	0
471	TODD	In full disclosure, would you release all of them?	0
472	CLINTON	I will look into it.	0
473	CLINTON	I don't know the status, but I will certainly look into it.	0
474	CLINTON	But, I can only repeat what is the fact that I spoke to a lot of different groups with a lot of different constituents, a lot of different kinds of members about issues that had to do with world affairs.	0
475	CLINTON	I probably described more times than I can remember how stressful it was advising the President about going after Bin Laden.	0
476	CLINTON	My view on this is look at my record.	0
477	CLINTON	Look at what I am proposing, and—we have a vigorous agreement here.	0
478	CLINTON	We both want to reign in the excesses of Wall Street.	0
479	CLINTON	I also want to reign in the excesses of Johnson Controls that we bailed out when they were an autoparts company, and we saved the auto industry, and now they want to avoid paying taxes.	0
480	CLINTON	I want to go after the pharmaceutical companies like Valeant, and Turns that are increasing prices without any regard to the impact on people's health.	0
481	CLINTON	Now, if all we're going to talk about is one part of our economy, and indeed one streak in our economy, we're missing the big oil companies.	0
482	CLINTON	We're missing other big energy companies.	0
483	CLINTON	We're missing the big picture, and I have a record of trying to go at the problems that actually exist, and I will continue to do that.	0
484	TODD	Senator, you sound like you want to respond.	0
485	TODD	Go ahead.	0
486	SANDERS	Yeah, I do.	0
487	SANDERS	I agree with much of what the Secretary said, but, madam Secretary, it is not one streak.	0
488	SANDERS	Wall Street is an entity of unbelievable economic and political power.	0
489	SANDERS	That's a fact.	0
490	SANDERS	And, I want to say something, and it may sound harsh, not to you, but to the American people.	0
491	SANDERS	In a sense, in my view, the business model of Wall Street is fraud.	0
492	SANDERS	It's fraud.	0
493	SANDERS	I believe that corruption is rampant, and the fact that major bank after major bank has reached multi billion dollar settlements with the United States government when we have a weak regulator system tells me that not only did we have to bail them out once, if we don't start breaking them up, we're going to have to bail them out again, and I do not want to see that happen...	0
494	CLINTON	... Well, Senator, no one wants to see that happen.	0
495	CLINTON	I mean, look, I care deeply about this because just like you I have met so many people who had their life savings wiped out, who lost their homes, who are barely back with their heads above water.	0
496	CLINTON	This was a disaster for our country, and we can never let that happen again.	0
497	CLINTON	We have no disagreement about this.	0
498	CLINTON	But, I think it's a broader target list than just Wall Street, and I believe that we have to be very focused on how we try to take back the power and increase the empowerment of the American people.	0
499	CLINTON	And, I think I have that kind of experience, maybe because they've beat me up for so many years, and I know exactly how to handle them because I've been in the arena with them time and time again.	0
500	MADDOW	Senator Sanders, let me turn to, I think, where this direction is heading anyway, which is the broader issue of big business and power in our political system.	0
501	MADDOW	You on the campaign trail have railed against big name American corporations like Boeing, and General Electric, and Wal Mart.	0
502	MADDOW	But, some big businesses in this country have also been part of advancing progressive goals like that nationwide initiative to expand employment opportunities for veterans.	0
503	MADDOW	That was all about cooperation between the Obama administration and some very big business.	0
504	MADDOW	The Affordable Care Act, some of the thorniest problems in that bill were worked out in cooperation with big business in order to accomplish progressive goals.	0
505	MADDOW	Could you work with them, or have you made enemies of big business in this country with the way you've approached them in this campaign?	0
506	SANDERS	Of course I can work with them, but let's be clear.	0
507	SANDERS	When I talked about Boeing and I talked about General Electric, what I was referring to is an outrage.	0
508	SANDERS	I suspect the secretary agrees request me.	0
509	SANDERS	Right now you have a loophole such that these guys are putting their profits, multi-billion dollar profitable corporations putting billions of dollars into the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and other tax havens.	0
510	SANDERS	And in a given year, Rachel, after making billions of dollars in profit, do you know how much they're paying in taxes to the United States government in a given year?	0
511	SANDERS	Zero.	0
512	SANDERS	Now explain to me how that makes any sense at all.	0
513	SANDERS	So what I have said with regard to Boeing and GE and other multinationals that pay zero taxes, you know what we're going to do?	0
514	SANDERS	We're going to end that loophole.	0
515	SANDERS	They are going to pay their fair share of taxes.	0
516	SANDERS	We're going to use that money to rebuild our infrastructure and create up to 13 million jobs.	0
517	SANDERS	Can I work with corporations?	0
518	SANDERS	Are there good corporations doing incredible cutting edge research and development?	0
519	SANDERS	Absolutely they are.	0
520	SANDERS	And we should be proud of them.	0
521	SANDERS	But on the other hand, there are many corporations who have turned their backs on the American worker, who have said, if I can make another nickel in profit by going to China and shutting down in the United States of America, that's what I will do.	0
522	SANDERS	I will do my best to transform our trade policy and take on these corporations who want to invest in low-income countries around the world rather than in the United States of America.	0
523	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
524	MADDOW	Senator Sanders, thank you.	0
525	MADDOW	And with that, we're going to take a break.	0
526	TODD	We'll be right back.	0
527	TODD	And we're going to get to trade and a lot of other issues.	0
528	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
529	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]	0
530	MADDOW	Welcome back—welcome back to the Democratic candidates' debate.	0
531	MADDOW	We're going to be talking about America in the world, both in terms of some trade issues, but also national security.	0
532	MADDOW	And Secretary Clinton, we're going to start with you.	0
533	MADDOW	There are more than 4,000 American troops back in Iraq right now as part of the fight against ISIS.	0
534	MADDOW	It has been 15 straight years of wars and multiple deployments for America's military families, who have borne such a disproportionate burden.	0
535	MADDOW	Is President Obama right to keep escalating the number of U.S. troops that's fighting ISIS right now?	0
536	CLINTON	Well, I think what the president understands, and what he's trying to do, is that we have to support the Arab and Kurdish fighters on the ground who are actually doing the fighting.	0
537	CLINTON	I agree with the president.	0
538	CLINTON	I've said myself, we will not send American combat troops back to either Syria or Iraq—that is off the table.	0
539	CLINTON	But we do have special forces, we do have trainers, we do have the military personnel who are helping with the airstrikes that the United States is leading so that we can try to take out ISIS infrastructure, take out their leadership.	0
540	CLINTON	And I think that, given the threat that ISIS poses to the region and beyond, as we have sadly seen in our own country, it is important to keep the Iraqi army on a path where they can actually take back territory, to work with the Sunni tribes in Anbar province and elsewhere so that their fighters can be also deployed, to work with the Kurds to provide them the support, but they're doing the fighting.	0
541	CLINTON	We're doing the support and enabling.	0
542	CLINTON	And I also think we've got to do more to stop foreign fighters, foreign funding and take ISIS on online, as well as doing everything necessary to keep us safe at home.	0
543	CLINTON	So as I look at what the president it doing, it adds up to me.	0
544	CLINTON	We just have to keep—try to get more support for those people on the ground in Syria and Iraq who have to actually physically take the territory back.	0
545	MADDOW	To be clear, to the specific question, if that strategic goal that you're describing requires considerably more of Americans—an ever-increasing number of Americans in Iraq and maybe in Syria, are you OK with the numbers increasing?	0
546	CLINTON	No.	0
547	CLINTON	I mean, of course that's a theoretical question, and we don't know what it would be for, and we don't know how many numbers there are.	0
548	CLINTON	I am against American combat troops being in Syria and Iraq.	0
549	CLINTON	I support special forces.	0
550	CLINTON	I support trainers.	0
551	CLINTON	I support the air campaign.	0
552	CLINTON	And I think we're making some progress.	0
553	CLINTON	I want to continue to intensify that, and that's exactly what the president is doing.	0
554	MADDOW	Thank you, Madam Secretary.	0
555	TODD	Go ahead, Senator Sanders—30 seconds, your response.	0
556	SANDERS	OK. Let me agree with much of what the secretary said, but where we have a different background on this issue is we differ on the war in Iraq, which created barbaric organizations like ISIS.	0
557	SANDERS	Not only did I vote against that war, I helped lead the opposition, and if you go to my website, berniesanders.com, you will see the statement that I made in 2002.	0
558	SANDERS	And it gives me no pleasure to tell you that much of what I feared would happen the day after Saddam Hussein was overthrown, in fact, did happen.	0
559	TODD	All right.	0
560	TODD	Senator, I want to stay, though...	0
561	CLINTON	If I could—if I could...	0
562	TODD	Go ahead.	0
563	TODD	30 seconds.	0
564	CLINTON	... respectfully add—look, we did differ.	0
565	CLINTON	A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS.	0
566	CLINTON	We have to look at the threats that we face right now...	0
567	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
568	CLINTON	...and we have to be prepared to take them on and defeat them.	0
569	TODD	Let me—let—we're gonna—we're staying—we're staying basically on this topic.	0
570	TODD	Obviously you've been emphasizing this difference on the Iraq war, but one place where you do agree, and one place where you voted to authorize the use of force, was in favor of the war in Afghanistan.	0
571	TODD	Right now, it is possible President Obama is going to be leaving the next president, perhaps President Sanders, at least 10,000 troops in Afghanistan.	0
572	TODD	How long will those troops be in Afghanistan under President Sanders?	0
573	SANDERS	Well, I think our great task is to make certain that our young men and women in the military do not get sucked into never- ending, perpetual warfare within the quagmire of Syria and Iraq.	0
574	SANDERS	And I will do my very best to make sure that that doesn't happen.	0
575	SANDERS	I agree with the secretary that I think what has to happen—and let me just mention what King Abdullah of Jordan said.	0
576	SANDERS	I think he hit the nail on the head.	0
577	SANDERS	And what he said is essentially the war against ISIS is a war for the soul of Islam.	0
578	SANDERS	And it must be Muslim troops on the ground that will destroy ISIS, with the support of a coalition of major powers—U.S., U.K., France, Germany and Russia.	0
579	SANDERS	So our job is to provide them the military equipment that they need; the air support they need; special forces when appropriate.	0
580	SANDERS	But at the end of the day for a dozen different reasons, not the least of which is that ISIS would like American combat troops on the ground so they could reach out to the Muslim world and say, "Look, we're taking on those terrible Americans."	0
581	SANDERS	The combat on the ground must be done by Muslim troops with our support.	0
582	SANDERS	We must not get involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.	0
583	TODD	Can you address a question on Afghanistan?	0
584	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
585	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]	0
586	TODD	How long are these troops going to be there?	0
587	TODD	If President Obama leaves you 10,000 troops, how long do you think they're going to be there?	0
588	SANDERS	Well, you can't simply withdraw tomorrow.	0
589	SANDERS	Wish we could, and allow, you know, the Taliban or anybody else to reclaim that country.	0
590	SANDERS	But what we must do, and what we have seen in recent months, is some progress in Iraq, where finally the Iraqi army, which has not been a particularly effective fighting force, retook Ramadi.	0
591	SANDERS	ISIS has lost I think 40 percent of the territory that it held in the last year.	0
592	SANDERS	Hopefully, and you know, one can't predict the future, that maybe our training and their fighting capabilities are improving and we are going to make some progress in destroying ISIS.	0
593	TODD	Secretary Clinton, 30 seconds: How long are these troops going to be in Afghanistan?	0
594	TODD	We have more American troops in Afghanistan than what we were talking about with Iraq.	0
595	CLINTON	Oh, absolutely.	0
596	CLINTON	The president decided to leave more troops than he had originally planned in Afghanistan.	0
597	CLINTON	We have a very cooperative government there, with Ashraf Ghani and his top—his top partner, Abdullah.	0
598	CLINTON	And they are doing their very best.	0
599	CLINTON	And the Afghan army is actually fighting.	0
600	CLINTON	The Afghan army is taking heavy losses defending Afghan territory.	0
601	CLINTON	And I would have to make an evaluation based on the circumstances at the time I took office as to how much help they continue to need.	0
602	CLINTON	Because it's not just the Taliban.	0
603	CLINTON	We now are seeing outposts of, you know, fighters claiming to be affiliated with ISIS.	0
604	CLINTON	So, we've got this arc of instability from North Africa to South Asia, and we have to pay close attention to it.	0
605	CLINTON	And we have to build coalitions, something that I did to take on the Iranian nuclear program, and what I will do as president to make sure that we defeat these terrorist networks.	0
606	TODD	You know, Senator Sanders, nobody knows who your foreign policy advisers are.	0
607	TODD	You haven't given a major foreign policy speech.	0
608	TODD	And it doesn't sound like all the time that foreign policy is a priority, other than when you're asked about it, and you say you're going to crush ISIS, as you said last night and earlier.	0
609	TODD	You have not proactively laid out a foreign policy doctrine yet.	0
610	TODD	Why?	0
611	SANDERS	Well, that's not quite accurate.	0
612	SANDERS	I did give a speech at Georgetown where I talked about democratic socialism and foreign policy.	0
613	SANDERS	Maybe I shouldn't have combined the two in the same speech, because the foreign policy part of it didn't get much attention.	0
614	SANDERS	So, let me take this opportunity to give you a very short speech here on the issue.	0
615	SANDERS	I think, while it is true that the secretary and I voted differently on the war in Iraq, what is important is that we learn the lesson of the war in Iraq.	0
616	SANDERS	And that lesson is intrinsic to my foreign policy if elected president, is the United States cannot do it alone.	0
617	SANDERS	We cannot be the policeman of the world.	0
618	SANDERS	We are now spending more I believe than the next eight countries on defense.	0
619	SANDERS	We have got to work in strong coalition with the major powers of the world and with those Muslim countries that are prepared to stand up and take on terrorism.	0
620	SANDERS	So I would say that the key doctrine of the Sanders administration would be no, we cannot continue to do it alone; we need to work in coalition.	0
621	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
622	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]	0
623	CLINTON	A group of national security experts, military intelligence experts, issued a very concerning statement about Senator Sanders's views on foreign policy and national security, pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issues, such as inviting Iranian troops into Syria to try to resolve the conflict there; putting them right at the doorstep of Israel.	1
624	CLINTON	Asking Saudi Arabia and Iran to work together, when they can't stand each other and are engaged in a proxy battle right at this moment.	0
625	CLINTON	So I do think questions have been raised and questions have to be answered because when New Hampshire voters go on Tuesday to cast your vote, you are voting both for a president and a commander in chief.	0
626	CLINTON	And there is no way to predict what comes in the door of that White House from day to day that can pose a threat to the United States or one of our friends and allies, and I think this is a big part of the job interview that we are all conducting with the voters here.	0
627	TODD	All right, Senator, 30 seconds.	0
628	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
629	SYSTEM	[ off-mike ]	0
630	SANDERS	I fully, fully concede that Secretary Clinton, who was secretary of State for four years, has more experience—hat is not arguable—in foreign affairs.	0
631	SANDERS	But experience is not the only point, judgment is.	0
632	SANDERS	And once again, back in 2002, when we both looked at the same evidence about the wisdom of the war in Iraq, one of us voted the right way and one of us didn't.	0
633	SANDERS	In terms of Iran and in terms of Saudi Arabia, of course they hate each other.	0
634	SANDERS	That's no great secret.	0
635	SANDERS	But John Kerry, who is I think doing a very good job, has tried to at least get these people in the room together because both of them are being threatened by ISIS.	0
636	CLINTON	Well, let me just add that, you know, I've said this before and I'm very proud of it, that when it comes to judgment, having run a hard race against Senator Obama at the time, he turned to me to be secretary of State.	0
637	CLINTON	And when it comes to the biggest counterterrorism issues that we faced in this administration, namely whether or not to go after bin Laden, I was at that table, I was exercising my judgment to advise the president on what to do, on that, on Iran, on Russia on China, on a whole raft of issues.	0
638	CLINTON	Because I know from my own experience that you've got to be ready on day one.	0
639	CLINTON	There is just too much unpredictable threat and danger in the world today, you know, to try to just say wait, I'll get to that when I can.	0
640	CLINTON	That is just not an acceptable approach.	0
641	SANDERS	Well...	0
642	MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, at the—at the last Democratic debate in Charleston—I want to get specific here—Senator Sanders called for moving as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran.	0
643	MADDOW	Your campaign has criticized him for saying that.	0
644	MADDOW	Now that he's standing next to you here on this stage, can you explain why the U.S. shouldn't try to normalize relations in Iran in your view?	0
645	CLINTON	Absolutely.	0
646	CLINTON	You know, I did put together the coalition to impose sanctions.	0
647	CLINTON	I actually started the negotiations that led to the nuclear agreement, sending some much my closest aides to begin the conversations with the Iranians.	0
648	CLINTON	I'm very pleased we got that nuclear agreement.	0
649	CLINTON	It puts a lid on the nuclear weapons program.	0
650	CLINTON	We have to enforce it, there have to be consequences attached to it.	0
651	CLINTON	But that is not our only problem with Iran.	0
652	CLINTON	We have to figure out how to deal with Iran as the principal state sponsor of terrorism in the world.	0
653	CLINTON	They are destabilizing governments in the region.	0
654	CLINTON	They continue to support Hezbollah and Hamas in Lebanon against Israel.	0
655	CLINTON	A lot of work that we have do is going to be incredibly hard.	0
656	CLINTON	I'm prepared to do that work, but I believe, just as I did with imposing the sanctions, you have to get action for action.	0
657	CLINTON	If we were to normalize relations right now, we would remove one of the biggest pieces of leverage we have to try to influence and change Iranian behavior.	0
658	CLINTON	The president doesn't think we should.	0
659	CLINTON	I certainly don't think we should.	0
660	CLINTON	I believe we have to take this step by step to try to reign in Iranian aggression, their support for terrorism and the other bad behavior that can come back and haunt us.	0
661	SANDERS	Who said That think we should normalize relations with Iran tomorrow?	0
662	SANDERS	I never said that.	0
663	SANDERS	I think we should move forward as quickly as we can.	0
664	SANDERS	And you're right.	0
665	SANDERS	They are a sponsor of terrorism around the world and we have to address that.	0
666	SANDERS	But you know, a number of years ago, people were saying normal relationship with Cuba, what a bad and silly idea.	0
667	SANDERS	They're Communists, they are our enemy.	0
668	SANDERS	Well guess what?	0
669	SANDERS	Change has come.	0
670	SANDERS	So please don't suggest that I think we normalize relations with Tehran tomorrow.	0
671	SANDERS	We don't.	0
672	SANDERS	But I would like to see us move forward, and hopefully some day that will happen.	0
673	SANDERS	And I would say if I might, Madam Secretary—and you can correct me if I'm wrong.	0
674	SANDERS	When you ran against Senator Obama you thought him naive because he thought it was a good idea to talk to our enemies.	0
675	SANDERS	I think those are exactly the people you have to talk to and you have to negotiate with.	0
676	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
677	CLINTON	Well Senator, let me just correct the record if I can.	0
678	CLINTON	You know—let me correct the record.	0
679	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]	0
680	TODD	30 seconds, madam secretary.	0
681	CLINTON	As I—as I certainly recall, the question was to meet with without conditions.	0
682	CLINTON	And you're right, I was against that.	0
683	CLINTON	I was against it then I would be against it now.	0
684	SANDERS	OK.	0
685	CLINTON	Part of diplomacy, the hard work of diplomacy is trying to extract whatever concessions you can get, and giving something the other side wants.	0
686	CLINTON	Of course you've got to try to make peace with, and work with those who are your adversaries, but you don't just rush in, open the door, and say, "Here I am.	0
687	CLINTON	Let's talk and make a deal."	0
688	CLINTON	That's not the way it works.	0
689	SANDERS	I think President Obama had the right idea, and the bottom line is that of course there have to be conditions.	0
690	SANDERS	But, of course it doesn't do us any good to not talk with our adversaries...	0
691	CLINTON	... Well, we set conditions on Iran.	0
692	CLINTON	We worked hard to get them established, and to be enforced, and then we talked.	0
693	CLINTON	That's exactly the right...	0

697	SANDERS	Just to set the record straight, I very strongly supported the agreement which makes certain that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.	0
698	TODD	Alright, as Commander in Chief, Senator Sanders, you've got to prioritize potential threats to the United States.	0
699	TODD	Three countries, North Korea, Iran, Russia.	0
700	TODD	How would you rank them in order of their threat to America's security right now...	0
701	SANDERS	... ISIS...	0
702	TODD	...	0
703	TODD	Starting with the biggest threat.	0
704	SANDERS	ISIS, you forgot one...	0
705	TODD	...	0
706	TODD	I didn't say that...	0
707	SANDERS	... No, no...	0
708	TODD	... No...	0
709	SANDERS	... ISIS would be ...	0
710	TODD	... We already had that.	0
711	TODD	I'm talking about these three countries.	0
712	TODD	How would you orient our national security, our national defense posture.	0
713	SANDERS	Clearly North Korea is a very strange situation because it is such an isolated country run by a handful of dictators, or maybe just one, who seems to be somewhat paranoid.	0
714	SANDERS	And, who had nuclear weapons.	0
715	SANDERS	And, our goal there, in my view, is to work and lean strongly on China to put as much pressure.	0
716	SANDERS	China is one of the few major countries in the world that has significant support for North Korea, and I think we got to do everything we can to put pressure on China.	0
717	SANDERS	I worry very much about an isolated, paranoid country with atomic bombs.	0
718	SANDERS	I think, clearly, we got to work closely with China to resolve the serious problems we have, and I worry about Putin and his military adventurism in the Crimea and the Ukraine.	0
719	TODD	Secretary of Defense Ash Carter this week picked one of those three, and he has said Russia is, basically, the most important national security threat.	0
720	TODD	Sort of reorienting the defense and the challenges to that.	0
721	TODD	Do you agree with his decisions...	0
722	SANDERS	... No, I don't.	0
723	SANDERS	I worry very, very much about an isolated country.	0
724	SANDERS	That's what makes me nervous.	0
725	SANDERS	Russia lives in the world.	0
726	SANDERS	China lives in the world.	0
727	SANDERS	North Korea is a very, very strange country because it is so isolated, and I do feel that a nation with nuclear weapons, they have got to be dealt with.	0
728	SANDERS	Dealt with effectively.	0
729	TODD	Secretary Clinton, what do you think of Secretary of Defense Ash Carter.	0
730	TODD	He's basically putting Russia above Iran, above North Korea, as sort of the chief national security challenge right now.	0
731	CLINTON	I haven't talked to Secretary Carter, but here's what I would think he's planning.	0
732	CLINTON	We do have the nuclear weapons agreement with Iran, that's an enforcement consequence, action for action, follow on.	0
733	CLINTON	We have a plan, we will watch them, we will be vigilant.	0
734	CLINTON	We do have to worry about North Korea.	0
735	CLINTON	They continue to develop their nuclear weapons capability, and they're working very hard on their ballistic missile capability.	0
736	CLINTON	And, I know that some of those plans could very well lead to a missile that might reach Hawaii, if not the West Coast.	0
737	CLINTON	We do have to try to get the countries in the region to work with us to do everything we can to confine, and constrain them.	0
738	CLINTON	But, what Secretary Carter is looking at is the constant pressure that Russia's putting on our European allies.	0
739	CLINTON	The way that Russia is trying to move the boundaries of the post-World War II Europe.	0
740	CLINTON	The way that he is trying to set European countries against one another, seizing territory, holding it in Crimea.	0
741	CLINTON	Beginning to explore whether they could make some inroads in the Baltics.	0
742	CLINTON	We know that they are deeply engaged in supporting Assad because they want to have a place in the Middle East.	0
743	CLINTON	They have a naval base, they have an air base in Syria.	0
744	CLINTON	They want to hang on to that.	0
745	CLINTON	I think what Secretary Carter is seeing, and I'm glad he is, is that we got to get NATO back working for the common defense.	0
746	CLINTON	We've got to do more to support our partners in NATO, and we have to send a very clear message to Putin that this kind of belligerence, that this kind of testing of boundaries will have to be responded to.	0
747	CLINTON	The best way to do that is to put more armor in, put more money from the Europeans in so they're actually contributing more to their own defense.	0
748	TODD	Thank you both, Rachel?	0
749	MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, I want to ask you about a national security issue that is closer to home.	0
750	MADDOW	There are thousands of veterans, over 100,000 veterans living in the state of New Hampshire.	0
751	MADDOW	If either one of you is nominated as the Democratic Party's nominee, you will likely face a Republican opponent in the general election who wants to privatize or even abolish big parts of the V.A.	0
752	MADDOW	It's a newly popular idea in conservative politics.	0
753	MADDOW	How will you win the argument on that issue given the problems that have been exposed at the V.A.	0
754	MADDOW	in the last few years?	0
755	MADDOW	What's your argument that the V.A.	0
756	MADDOW	should still exist and should not be privatized?	0
757	CLINTON	Well, first of all, I'm absolutely against privatizing the V.A.	0
758	CLINTON	And I am going do everything I can to build on the reforms that Senator Sanders and others in Congress have passed to try to fix what's wrong with the V.A.	0
759	CLINTON	There are a lot of issues about wait times and services that have to be fixed because our veterans deserve nothing but the best.	0
760	CLINTON	But you're absolutely right, you know, Rachel, this is another part of the Koch brothers agenda.	0
761	CLINTON	They've actually formed an organization to try to begin to convince Americans we should no longer have guaranteed health care, specialized care for our veterans.	0
762	CLINTON	I will fight that as hard as I can.	0
763	CLINTON	I think there's where we can enlist the veterans service organizations, the veterans of America, because, yes, let's fix the V.A., but we will never let it be privatized, and that is a promise.	0
764	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
765	MADDOW	Senator Sanders, you, as a congressional leader on veterans issues and the Veterans Committee, you've worked in a very bipartisan way with Senator John McCain and others on veterans issues.	0
766	MADDOW	Is the right contour of the fight, the way she's talking about this issue?	0
767	SANDERS	Let me agree.	0
768	SANDERS	You know, as the secretary knows, I chaired—I had the privilege and the honor of chairing the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs.	0
769	SANDERS	And it is interesting to me, you know, Republicans give a lot of speeches about how much they love veterans.	0
770	SANDERS	I work with the American Legion, the VFW, the DAV, the Vietnam Vets, and virtually every veterans organization to put together the most comprehensive piece of the veterans legislation in the modern history of America.	0
771	SANDERS	That's what I did.	0
772	SANDERS	And I brought it to the floor of the Senate.	0
773	SANDERS	Every Democrat voted for it, I got two Republicans.	0
774	SANDERS	We ended up with 56 votes and I couldn't get the 60 votes that I needed.	0
775	SANDERS	That is pathetic.	0
776	SANDERS	This was legislation supported by all of the veterans organizations, addressing many of the serious problems that veterans face in health care and in how we deliver benefits to them.	0
777	SANDERS	So Republicans talk a good game about veterans, but when it came to put money on the line to protect our veterans, frankly, they were not there.	0
778	SANDERS	What I did next, Rachel, is I had to retreat a little bit, I had to compromise.	0
779	SANDERS	I did work with John McCain.	0
780	SANDERS	I did work with Jeff Miller over in the House.	0
781	SANDERS	And we put together not the bill that I wanted, but probably the most comprehensive V.A.	0
782	SANDERS	health care bill in the modern history of this country.	0
783	SANDERS	Secretary Clinton is absolutely right, there are people, Koch brothers among others, who have a group called Concerned Veterans of America, funded by the Koch brothers.	0
784	SANDERS	The Koch brothers, by the way, want to destroy Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, every governmental program passed since the 1930s.	0
785	SANDERS	Yes, there are people out there who want to privatize it.	0
786	SANDERS	The last point that I'd make.	0
787	SANDERS	I had a hearing.	0
788	SANDERS	I had all of the veterans groups in front of me.	0
789	SANDERS	And I said to them, tell me when a veteran gets in to the V.A., understanding there are waiting lines and real problems, when a veteran gets into the system, is the quality of care good?	0
790	SANDERS	Without exception, what they said, good, excellent, very good.	0
791	SANDERS	We've got to strengthen the V.A.	0
792	SANDERS	We do not privatize the V.A.	0

801	TODD	Senator Sanders, The Iowa Democratic Party has declared Hillary Clinton the winner of Monday's Iowa caucuses—narrowest of margins.	0
802	TODD	Today, the Des Moines Register has an editorial that calls for the audit of the results, saying, quote, "what happened Monday night at the Democratic caucuses was a debacle, period.	0
803	TODD	The results were too close not to do a complete audit."	0
804	TODD	Senator Sanders, do you accept the idea that Hillary Clinton won Iowa?	0
805	TODD	And do you—or do you believe the caucuses are still an open question?	0
806	SANDERS	Well, I agree with the Des Moines Register, but let's not blow this out of proportion.	0
807	SANDERS	This is not a—this is not, like, a winner-take-all thing.	0
808	SANDERS	I think where we now stand—correct me if I'm wrong—you have 22 delegates, I have 20 delegates.	0
809	SANDERS	We need 2,500 delegates to win the nomination.	0
810	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
811	SANDERS	You know, so this is not—this is not the biggest deal in the world.	0
812	SANDERS	We think, by the way, based on talking to our precinct captains, we may have at least two more delegates.	0
813	SANDERS	What the Des Moines Register said—you know, there were coin—I think there were half a dozen coin flips—a fairly chaotic type situation.	0
814	SANDERS	At the end of the day, no matter how it's recounted, it will break roughly even.	0
815	SANDERS	And by the way, I love and respect the caucus process in Iowa.	0

825	TODD	That's fair enough.	0
826	TODD	OK.	0
827	CLINTON	All right.	0
828	TODD	Good, we move on.	0
829	TODD	We're happy with that.	0
830	TODD	We have more questions.	0
831	MADDOW	Senator—Senator Sanders, in 1964...	0
832	SANDERS	Oh	0
833	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]	0
834	SANDERS	.	0
835	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
836	SANDERS	See, when you are old, then they go back all these years.	0
837	SANDERS	All right.	0
838	SANDERS	What have you got?	0
839	MADDOW	In 1964, I heard that the Republicans nominated Barry Goldwater, who was the hero of the conservative movement.	0
840	MADDOW	He was, however, far to the right of most of that party.	0
841	MADDOW	In 1972, the Democrats nominated George McGovern, who was a hero of liberals in the antiwar movement, but he was to the left of his party's mainstream.	0
842	MADDOW	Both of those nominees made activists very excited, and they both got destroyed in the general election.	0
843	MADDOW	Even Democrats who love you worry about your fate in a general election.	0
844	MADDOW	And I know you have good head-to-head polling numbers against Republican frontrunners right now.	0
845	MADDOW	We know that.	0
846	MADDOW	But do you have a general election strategy that is different than the way you're running right now to try to get the nomination?	0
847	SANDERS	Well, you know, a general election is different than a primary and caucus process.	0
848	SANDERS	But let me just say this.	0
849	SANDERS	In terms of where we are right now, as you mention, Rachel, in a number of national and state, including New Hampshire.	0
850	SANDERS	For example, the last poll I saw—there may have been a new one—last one I saw here in New Hampshire, a battleground state, had me defeating Trump by 19; the secretary defeating him by one.	0
851	SANDERS	There were also pretty large margins in Iowa and Wisconsin.	0
852	SANDERS	These are polls.	0
853	SANDERS	Polls go up.	0
854	SANDERS	Polls go down.	0
855	SANDERS	But here's why I think I will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate.	0
856	SANDERS	Democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process.	0
857	SANDERS	Republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression.	0
858	SANDERS	I believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout.	0
859	SANDERS	If there is a large voter turnout, not only do we retain the White House, but I think we regain the Senate.	0
860	SANDERS	We win governors' chairs up and down the line.	0
861	SANDERS	So I believe if you want to retain the White House, if you want to see Democrats do well across the board, I think our campaign is the one that creates the large voter turnout and helps us win.	0
862	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
863	MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, your campaign surrogates, and people who have endorsed you, have suggested that or even said that if Senator Sanders is the nominee, that Democrats will suffer nationwide and the chances will go down of Democrats holding onto the White House.	0
864	MADDOW	With him here standing next to you, can you tell us whether or not you believe he would win the general election if he were nominated?	0
865	CLINTON	I can only tell you what I believe, and that is that I am the strongest candidate to take it to the Republicans and win in November.	0
866	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
867	CLINTON	And I say that with great—with great respect for the campaign that Senator Sanders has been running.	0
868	CLINTON	I personally am thrilled at the numbers of people, and particularly young people who are coming to support your campaign.	0
869	CLINTON	I hope that I will be able to earn their support.	0
870	CLINTON	They may not support me now, but I support them and we'll work together.	0
871	CLINTON	But what I'm concerned about is the views of many Democrats who know their states, who know how hard it is to win a general election.	0
872	CLINTON	And it also will push whoever the nominee is into the spotlight.	0
873	CLINTON	I've been vetted.	0
874	CLINTON	There's hardly anything you don't know about me.	0
875	CLINTON	And I think it's fair to say that whoever is in that position, Senator Sanders or anyone else who might have run, will face the most withering onslaught.	0
876	CLINTON	So, I think that I am the person who can do all aspects of the job.	0
877	CLINTON	I think I'm the person best prepared to take the case to the Republicans.	0
878	CLINTON	And I think that at the end of the day, it's not so much electability.	0
879	CLINTON	It is who the American people can believe can keep them safe, can get the economy moving again, can get incomes rising, can build on the progressive accomplishments of President Obama.	0
880	CLINTON	And I think that the coalition that President Obama put together to win twice is a coalition that I can put together and add to.	0
881	CLINTON	And that's what I'm prepared to...	0
882	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0

884	TODD	We'll stay on this issue.	0
885	TODD	We'll stay on this topic.	0
886	TODD	Secretary Clinton, just like there are some Democrats that question Senator Sanders' ability in the general election, many Democratic voters that our reporters have been running into in Iowa and New Hampshire, they tell our reporters over and over again they're worried about the emails issue, not because they don't believe your explanation, but because it's a drip-drip, because the cloud is hanging over your head and that it will impact the general election.	0
887	TODD	They see your numbers right now and they think it's the email issue as to why you're not polling very well.	0
888	TODD	So can you reassure these Democrats that somehow the email issue isn't going to blow up your candidacy if you're the nominee?	0
889	CLINTON	Absolutely I can.	0
890	CLINTON	You know, before it was emails, it was Benghazi, and the Republicans were stirring up so much controversy about that.	0
891	CLINTON	And I testified for 11 hours, answered their questions.	0
892	CLINTON	They basically said yeah, didn't get her.	0
893	CLINTON	We tried.	0
894	CLINTON	That was all a political ploy.	0
895	CLINTON	Now, we had a development in the email matter today when it came out that Secretary Powell and close aides to Former Secretary Rice used private e-mail accounts.	0
896	CLINTON	and now you have these people in the government who are doing the same thing to Secretary Powell and Secretary Rice's aide they've been doing to me, which is that I never sent or received any classified material.	0
897	CLINTON	They are retroactively classifying it.	0
898	CLINTON	I agree completely with Secretary Powell, who said today this is an absurdity.	0
899	CLINTON	And so I think the American people will know it's an absurdity.	0
900	CLINTON	I have absolutely no concerns about it whatsoever.	0
901	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
902	TODD	All right, Madam Secretary, there is an open—there is an open FBI investigation into this matter about how you may have handled classified material.	0
903	TODD	Are you 100 percent confident that nothing is going to come of this FBI investigation?	0
904	CLINTON	I am 100 percent confident.	0
905	CLINTON	This is a security review that was requested.	0
906	CLINTON	It is being carried out.	0
907	CLINTON	It will be resolved.	0
908	CLINTON	But I have to add if there's going to be a security review about me, there's going to have to be security reviews about a lot of other people, including Republican office holders, because we've got this absurd situation of retroactive classifications.	0
909	CLINTON	Honest to goodness, this is—this just beggars the imagination.	0
910	CLINTON	So I have absolutely no concerns about it, but we've got to get to the bottom of what's really going on here, and I hope that will happen.	0
911	TODD	Well, Senator sanders, you famously at the first debate said you didn't give a darn about her emails; I think you used another	0

914	SYSTEM	[ off-mike ]	0
915	TODD	You're right.	0

917	TODD	After 11:00, I'll say it the other way.	0
918	TODD	And you mostly have refrained from commenting on it, but recently you called it a very serious issue, and then the other day you said well she's getting slapped with the email controversy.	0
919	TODD	Are you—how are you feeling about these darn emails now?	0
920	SANDERS	I am feeling exactly the way I felt at the first debate.	0
921	SANDERS	There's a process under way.	0
922	SANDERS	I will not politicize it.	0
923	TODD	OK.	0
924	TODD	Senator Sanders, thank you.	0
925	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
926	SANDERS	And by the way—and by the way, if I may, the secretary probably doesn't know that there's not a day that goes by when I am not asked to attack her on that issue, and I have refrained from doing that and I will continue to refrain from doing that.	0
927	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
928	MADDOW	Senator Sanders, thank you.	0
929	MADDOW	Senator, in December, one of your campaign staffers was fired from your campaign for taking voter data essentially from the Clinton campaign.	0
930	MADDOW	You apologized for that when the incident was made public.	0
931	MADDOW	Your campaign has now been criticized for its operatives essentially impersonating culinary union members wearing union pins in Nevada, and the Nashua Telegraph has complained recently that you falsely implied in an advertisement that they had endorsed you when they did not.	0
932	MADDOW	None of these issues obviously is the end of the world, but they all are of a piece.	0
933	MADDOW	Are you in some sense losing control of your campaign?	0
934	SANDERS	Not losing control of our campaign.	0
935	SANDERS	You know, we have hired a whole lot of people in a rapid way and I am familiar with the first two instances and they are unacceptable, and we have apologized and dealt with that.	0
936	SANDERS	In terms of the last one, as I understand it, we did not suggest that we had the endorsement of a newspaper.	0
937	SANDERS	Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates, and to the best of my knowledge, that is what we did.	0
938	SANDERS	So we never said, never said that somebody, a newspaper endorsed us that did not.	0
939	SANDERS	What we did say is blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaper.	0
940	MADDOW	Just to follow up on that, the title of the ad in question was Endorsement.	0
941	SANDERS	But that was only for—that was not to be on television.	0
942	SANDERS	That's an important point.	0
943	SANDERS	That was just something—as the secretary knows, you put titles on ads and you send them out, but there was no word in that ad, none, that said that those newspapers had endorsed us.	0
944	MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, do you want 30 seconds on that issue?	0
945	CLINTON	No.	0
946	MADDOW	And with that, we will	0

951	MADDOW	Welcome back to the University of New Hampshire, and the Democratic candidates' debate.	0
952	MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, on the issue of the death penalty, here in New Hampshire, the one person who is on death row is there for killing a police officer.	0
953	MADDOW	It's a crime that has caused anguish in this state, both among death penalty opponents and death penalty supporters.	0
954	MADDOW	The last time I had the chance to talk with you on this issue, on the death penalty, you said that capital punishment has a place in a very few federal cases, but you also said you would breathe a sigh of relief if the Supreme Court abolished the death penalty nationwide.	0
955	MADDOW	Tonight, do you still support capital punishment, even if you do so reluctantly?	0
956	CLINTON	Yes, I do.	0
957	CLINTON	And—you know, what I hope the Supreme Court will do is make it absolutely clear that any state that continues capital punishment either must meet the highest standards of evidentiary proof of effective assistance of counsel or they cannot continue it because that, to me, is the real dividing line.	0
958	CLINTON	I have much more confidence in the federal system, and I do reserve it for particularly heinous crimes in the federal system, like terrorism.	0
959	CLINTON	I have strong feelings about that.	0
960	CLINTON	I thought it was appropriate after a very thorough trial that Timothy McVeigh received the death penalty for blowing up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people, including 19 children in a daycare center.	0
961	CLINTON	I do for very limited, particularly heinous crimes believe it is an appropriate punishment, but I deeply disagree with the way that too many states are still implementing it.	0
962	CLINTON	If it were possible to separate the federal from the state system by the Supreme Court, that would, I think, be an appropriate outcome.	0
963	MADDOW	Senator Sanders, you have singled out the death penalty, and Senator Clinton's support for the death penalty, as an issue that makes it hard to consider as progressive in your mind...	0
964	SANDERS	... Look, I hear what the Secretary said, and I understand, but look, there are—all of us know that we have seen in recent years horrible, horrible crimes.	0
965	SANDERS	It's hard to imagine how people can do, bomb, and kill 168 people in Oklahoma City, or do the Boston Marathon bombing, but this is what I believe, and for a couple of reasons.	0
966	SANDERS	Number one, too many innocent people, including minorities, African Americans, have been executed when they were not guilty.	0
967	SANDERS	That's number one.	0
968	SANDERS	We have to be very careful about making sure about that.	0
969	SANDERS	But, second of all, and maybe, in a deeper reason, of course there are barbaric acts out there.	0
970	SANDERS	But, in a world of so much violence and killing, I just don't believe that government itself should be part of the killing.	0
971	SANDERS	So, when somebody commits...	0
972	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
973	SANDERS	...somebody commits any of these terrible crimes that we have seen, you lock them up, and you toss away the key.	0
974	SANDERS	They're never going to get out.	0
975	SANDERS	But, I just don't' want to see government be part of killing.	0
976	SANDERS	That's all.	0
977	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
978	MADDOW	Another issue related to the proper role of government, and in this case, specifically the role of government between the federal government and the states.	0
979	MADDOW	I want to talk for a moment about the issue of Flint, Michigan.	0
980	MADDOW	On the Flint lead poisoning disaster, you have both been highly critical of Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan, and how the state in Michigan both caused the lead poisoning problem, and has not acted fast enough to fix it.	0
981	MADDOW	You have both been outspoken on that.	0
982	MADDOW	The fact is that Michigan though has not fixed it.	0
983	MADDOW	There is no door to door delivery of clean water in Flint even today.	0
984	MADDOW	Not a single lead pipe has been replaced in Flint, even today.	0
985	MADDOW	If the state is failing, would you, Secretary Clinton, would you as President order a federal response to get it right over and above the wishes of the state?	0
986	CLINTON	Absolutely.	0
987	CLINTON	Absolutely.	0
988	CLINTON	You know, Rachel, you and I have talked about this before.	0
989	CLINTON	I thank you for going to Flint to hold that town hall.	0
990	CLINTON	I will be in Flint at the Mayor's invitation on Sunday to get an in depth briefing about what is, and is not happening.	0
991	CLINTON	This is an emergency.	0
992	CLINTON	Everyday that goes by that these people, particularly the children, are not tested so we can know what steps must be taken to try to remediate the effects of the poisoning that they have been living with is a day lost in a child's life.	0
993	CLINTON	I know from the work that I've done over so many years, lead, the toxic nature of lead can affect you brain development, your body development, your behavior.	0
994	CLINTON	I absolutely believe that what is being done is not sufficient.	0
995	CLINTON	We need to be absolutely clear about everything that should be done from today to tomorrow, into the future to try to remedy the terrible burden that the people of Flint are barring.	0
996	CLINTON	That includes fixing their pipes, it includes guaranteeing whatever healthcare and educational embellishments they may need going forward, and I think the federal government has way where it can bill the state of Michigan.	0
997	CLINTON	If Michigan won't do it, there have to be ways that we can begin to move, and then make them pay for it, and hold them accountable.	0
998	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
999	MADDOW	Senator Sanders are there things the President could be doing?	0
1000	MADDOW	President Obama could be ordering, done, right now, in Flint, Michigan that are not being done that you as President would do?	0
1001	SANDERS	Absolutely.	0
1002	SANDERS	I think the Secretary described the situation appropriately.	0
1003	SANDERS	You know, I don't go around asking for governor's resignations every day.	0
1004	SANDERS	In fact, I think I never have in my life.	0
1005	SANDERS	But I did ask for the resignation of Governor Snyder because his irresponsibility...	0
1006	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1007	SANDERS	...was so outrageous.	0
1008	SANDERS	What we are talking about are children being poisoned.	0
1009	SANDERS	That's what we're talking about.	0
1010	SANDERS	We don't know, no one knows for sure because they haven't done the appropriate studies, but there's no question that kids' intellectual development may have been impacted.	0
1011	SANDERS	We don't know how many thousands.	0
1012	SANDERS	The idea that there has not been a dramatic response is beyond comprehension.	0
1013	SANDERS	And when you have one of the, I think, significant public health crises of recent years, of course the federal government comes in.	0
1014	SANDERS	And of course the federal government says, you're not going to be poisoning little kids and impacting their entire lives.	0
1015	SANDERS	Last point on this.	0
1016	SANDERS	And I suspect the secretary agrees.	0
1017	SANDERS	One wonders if this were a white suburban community what kind of response there would have been.	0
1018	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1019	SANDERS	Flint, Michigan, is a poor community.	0
1020	SANDERS	It is disproportionately African-American and minority.	0
1021	SANDERS	And what has happened there is absolutely unacceptable.	0
1022	MADDOW	Senator, thank you.	0
1023	TODD	Secretary Clinton, let me turn to the issue of trade.	0
1024	TODD	In the '90s you supported NAFTA.	0
1025	TODD	But you opposed it when you ran for the president in 2008.	0
1026	TODD	As secretary of state, you supported TPP, and then—which, of course, is that trade agreement with a lot of Asian countries, but you now oppose it as you make your second bid for president.	0
1027	TODD	If elected, should Democrats expect that once you're in office you will then become supportive of these trade agreements again?	0
1028	CLINTON	You know, Chuck, I've only had responsibility for voting for trade agreements as a senator.	0
1029	CLINTON	And I voted a multinational trade agreement when I was senator, the CAFTA agreement, because I did not believe it was in the best interests of the workers of America, of our incomes, and I opposed it.	0
1030	CLINTON	I did hope that the TPP, negotiated by this administration, would put to rest a lot of the concerns that many people have expressed about trade agreements.	0
1031	CLINTON	And I said that I was holding out that hope that it would be the kind of trade agreement that I was looking for.	0
1032	CLINTON	I waited until it had actually been negotiated because I did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the administration.	1
1033	CLINTON	Once I saw what the outcome was, I opposed it.	0
1034	CLINTON	Now I have a very clear view about this.	0
1035	CLINTON	We have to trade with the rest of the world.	0
1036	CLINTON	We are 5 percent of the world's population.	0
1037	CLINTON	We have to trade with the other 95 percent.	0
1038	CLINTON	And trade has to be reciprocal.	0
1039	CLINTON	That's the way the global economy works.	0
1040	CLINTON	But we have failed to provide the basic safety net support that American workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy.	0
1041	CLINTON	So it's not just what's in the trade agreement that I'm interested in.	0
1042	CLINTON	I did help to renegotiate the trade agreement that we inherited from President Bush with Korea.	0
1043	CLINTON	We go the UAW on board because of changes we made.	0
1044	CLINTON	So there are changes that I believe would make a real difference if they could be achieved, but I do not currently support it as it is written.	0
1045	TODD	Well, Senator Sanders, I know you want to respond on this, you have never supported a trade deal since you've been in Congress.	0
1046	SANDERS	Absolutely right.	0
1047	TODD	But if you do that as president...	0
1048	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1049	TODD	If you do that as president, how are you not essentially letting China, who will do all of these deals around the world, how are you going to prevent China from essentially setting the rules of trade for the world?	0
1050	SANDERS	Chuck, I believe in trade, but I do not believe in unfettered free trade.	0
1051	SANDERS	I believe in fair trade which works for the middle class and working families of this country and not just large multinational corporations.	0
1052	SANDERS	I was not only in opposition to NAFTA—and this is an area where the secretary and I have disagreements.	0
1053	SANDERS	I was not only in opposition to NAFTA, I was on the picket line in opposition to NAFTA because I understood—I don't think this is really rocket science.	0
1054	SANDERS	We heard all of the people tell us how many great jobs would be created.	0
1055	SANDERS	I didn't believe that for a second because I understood what the function of NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, and the TPP is, it's to say to American workers, hey, you are now competing against people in Vietnam who make 56 cents an hour minimum wage.	0
1056	SANDERS	I don't want American workers to compete against people making 56 cents an hour.	0
1057	SANDERS	I don't want companies shutting down in America, throwing people out on the street, moving to China, and bringing their products back into this country.	0
1058	SANDERS	So, do I believe in trade?	0
1059	SANDERS	Of course, I believe in trade.	0
1060	SANDERS	But the current trade agreements over the last 30 years were written by corporate America, for corporate America, resulted in the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs, 60,000 factories in America lost since 2001, millions of decent-paying jobs; and also a downward spiral, a race to the bottom where employers say, "Hey, you don't want to take a cut in pay?	0
1061	SANDERS	We're going to China."	0
1062	SANDERS	Workers today are working longer hours for lower wages.	1
1063	SANDERS	Trade is one of the reasons for that.	0
1064	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1065	TODD	All right.	0
1066	TODD	Thank you both.	0
1067	TODD	We're going to sneak in one more break here, and when we come back we'll squeeze as many questions as we can before we end this thing.	0

1073	MADDOW	The home stretch.	0
1074	TODD	The home stretch of this only Democratic debate in the final week before the primary.	0
1075	TODD	Let me start with you, Secretary Clinton, on this question.	0
1076	TODD	Obviously, President Obama got a lot of ambitious stuff done in his first year and a half.	0
1077	TODD	You're going to have to make choices.	0
1078	TODD	And there's a lot of heavy lifts.	0
1079	TODD	And he made choices.	0
1080	TODD	He did healthcare and it came at the expense, arguably, of immigration reform.	0
1081	TODD	Had he put immigration reform first, perhaps that gets done and healthcare doesn't.	0
1082	TODD	So there are three big lifts that you've talked about: immigration, gun reform, climate change.	0
1083	TODD	What do you do first?	0
1084	TODD	Because you know the first one is the one you have the best shot at getting done.	0
1085	CLINTON	Well, I—I don't accept that premise, Chuck.	0
1086	CLINTON	I think that we've got so much business we have to do.	0
1087	CLINTON	We've talked a lot tonight about what we're against—we're against income inequality.	0
1088	CLINTON	We're against the abuses of powerful interests.	0
1089	CLINTON	We're against a lot of things.	0
1090	CLINTON	I'm for a lot of things.	0
1091	CLINTON	I don't want to just stop bad things from happening, I want to start good things from happening.	0
1092	CLINTON	And I believe, if I'm so fortunate to get the nomination, I will begin to work immediately on putting together an agenda, beginning to talk with members of Congress and others about how we can push forward.	0
1093	CLINTON	I want to have half a billion more solar panels deployed, the first four years.	0

1095	CLINTON	I want to have enough clean energy to power every home the next four years.	0
1096	CLINTON	I want us to keep working on the Affordable Care Act, to get not only to 100 percent coverage, but bring down the costs of prescription drugs and out-of-pocket costs.	0
1097	CLINTON	I want to move forward on paid family leave, on early childhood education, I want us to do more for small businesses.	0
1098	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1099	CLINTON	Small businesses have to create most of the jobs, and we're not creating and growing small businesses.	0
1100	CLINTON	I think, if you have a smart agenda, you pick the committees that you know have to begin to work on these various pieces—because that's the way Congress is set up.	0
1101	CLINTON	You go through different committees, and you really make a big push in the beginning.	0
1102	CLINTON	Immigration reform, economic revitalization with manufacturing, with infrastructure—we put it out there, and we begin to work on an ambitious, big, bold agenda that will actually produce the results that I want to see for our country.	0
1103	TODD	All right, but Senator Sanders...	0
1104	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1105	TODD	...you've still got to do something first.	0
1106	TODD	As you know, history said—shows what you pick first is your best shot at getting, and how you prioritize things.	0
1107	SANDERS	No, let...	0
1108	TODD	Immigration reform, for instance, fell by the wayside in the first term because of this.	0
1109	SANDERS	...	0
1110	SANDERS	I am absolutely supportive of comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for 11 million people today who are living in the shadows.	0
1111	SANDERS	All right?	0
1112	SANDERS	We got to do that.	0
1113	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1114	SANDERS	But you miss—when you looked at the issues, you missed two of the most important.	0
1115	SANDERS	And that is you're not going to accomplish what has to be done for working families and the middle class unless there is campaign finance reform.	0
1116	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1117	SANDERS	So long as big money interests control the United States Congress, it is gonna be very hard to do what has to be done for working families.	0
1118	SANDERS	So let me be very clear.	0
1119	SANDERS	No nominee of mine, if I'm elected president, to the United States Supreme Court will get that nomination unless he or she is loud and clear, and says they will vote to overturn Citizens United.	0
1120	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1121	SANDERS	Second point—second point is that the only way we make change in terms of health care, in terms of dealing with a broken criminal justice system which, today, allows us to have more people in jail than any other country—largely African-American and Latino—the only way we create millions of jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure or have a tax system that says to the wealthy that they are going to pay their fair share, is when millions of people become involved in the political process.	0
1122	SANDERS	No, you just can't negotiate with Mitch McConnell.	0
1123	SANDERS	Mitch is gonna have to look out the window and see a whole lot of people saying, "Mitch, stop representing the billionaire class.	0
1124	SANDERS	Start listening to working families."	0
1125	SANDERS	And as president, that's what I will work hard on.	0
1126	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1127	TODD	OK.	0
1128	TODD	Thank you.	0
1129	MADDOW	Secretary Clinton, Republicans, particularly in campaign years, often talk about which departments of government—which agencies of government they would get rid of if they were elected president.	0
1130	MADDOW	The EPA, the Department of Education, the Commerce Department, oops—is—is there a department of government that you would get rid of?	0
1131	MADDOW	Or is there a whole new one that you would create?	0
1132	CLINTON	The answer to both of those is no.	0
1133	CLINTON	I'm interested in making what we have work better.	0
1134	CLINTON	I want to streamline programs that are duplicative and redundant.	0
1135	CLINTON	I want to have a top-to-bottom review about what works and what doesn't work, and be absolutely clear we're getting rid of what doesn't work.	0
1136	CLINTON	I have had the opportunity to run a big agency.	0
1137	CLINTON	I was very flattered when Henry Kissinger said I ran the State Department better—better than anybody had run it in a long time.	0
1138	CLINTON	So I have an idea of what it's going to take to make our government work more efficiently.	0
1139	CLINTON	And when you put together a budget, you have to make a lot of hard decisions, but I think it's not appropriate to say "I'm going to get rid of this, get rid of that" until you have a very good process that gives you the information about what to do.	0
1140	CLINTON	But I want to add something else, you know, because look, we have so much work to do in our country, and I think it's the greatest work that Americans will be called to do.	0
1141	CLINTON	And of course, we have to have people in every community involved in it.	0
1142	CLINTON	We have to have the political voice, the political grassroots speaking up and speaking out about what we have to try to accomplish in Washington.	0
1143	CLINTON	But we also need to have a very clear set of goals that we are going to achieve, and we need to level with the American people about what they are, what they will cost, what will be expected of our citizenry.	0
1144	CLINTON	So I see as president having a constant dialogue with Americans here's what we're trying to get done, here's why I need your help, here's why you may think comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship isn't something you care about, but I'm telling you it will help fix the labor market, it will bring people out of the shadows—	0
1145	MADDOW	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.	0
1146	CLINTON	—it will actually raise wages.	0
1147	CLINTON	You have to make all those connections so that you've got people with you every step of the way.	0
1148	CLINTON	That's what I want to do.	0
1149	MADDOW	Thank you very much.	0
1150	MADDOW	Thank you.	0
1151	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1152	TODD	All right, before we go, I want to ask each one of these.	0
1153	TODD	Secretary Clinton, you've made it clear when you look at Senator Sanders, you do not see a president, but do you see—	0
1154	CLINTON	I never said that.	0
1155	TODD	But do you see—do you see a vice president?	0
1156	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]	0
1157	CLINTON	Look...	0
1158	TODD	Would you unite the party by trying to pick Senator Sanders as your running mate?	0
1159	CLINTON	Well, I'm certainly going to unite the party, but I'm not—I'm not getting ahead of myself.	0
1160	CLINTON	I think that would be a little bit presumptuous.	0
1161	CLINTON	If I'm so fortunate as to be the nominee, the first person I will call to talk to about where we go and how we get it done will be Senator Sanders.	0
1162	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1163	TODD	Senator, would you consider the secretary?	0
1164	SANDERS	I agree with what the secretary said.	0
1165	SANDERS	We shouldn't be getting ahead of ourselves.	0
1166	SANDERS	And as I have said many times, you know, sometimes in these campaigns, things get a little bit out of hand.	0
1167	SANDERS	I happen to respect the secretary very much, I hope it's mutual.	0
1168	SANDERS	And on our worst days, I think it is fair to say we are 100 times better than any Republican candidate.	0
1169	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1170	CLINTON	That's true.	0
1171	CLINTON	That's true.	0
1172	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]	0
1173	TODD	Secretary Clinton, closing statements.	0
1174	TODD	You are first.	0
1175	CLINTON	Well first, thanks to MSNBC and thanks to all of you for holding this debate before the New Hampshire primary.	0
1176	CLINTON	I am going to campaign as hard as I can between now and Tuesday to earn your votes in that primary, and I hear some talk that people are trying to decide do they vote with their heart, do they vote with their head, I'm asking you to bring both your heart and your head to vote with you on Tuesday because we have a lot of work that can only come because your heart is moved.	0
1177	CLINTON	You know, we didn't get to talk about the continuing struggles that Americans face with racism, with sexism, with discrimination against the LGBT community, with new Americans, with people with disabilities.	0
1178	CLINTON	Yes, we have income inequality, we have other forms of inequality that we need to stand up against and absolutely diminish from our society.	0
1179	CLINTON	So I have been moved by my heart ever since I was a young woman about the age of a lot of Senator Sanders' supporters worrying what I can do to make a difference for my country, and I will bring that heart with me, but I will also tell you we've got to get our heads together to come up with the best answers to solve the problems so that people can have real differences in their lives that will make them better for now and into the future.	0
1180	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1181	TODD	Thank you, Madam Secretary.	0
1182	TODD	Senator Sanders.	0
1183	SANDERS	I—my dad came to this country at the age of 17 from Poland.	0
1184	SANDERS	Didn't have any money, couldn't speak English, he died pretty young, and I think it would have been beyond his wildest dreams to see his son up here on this stage today running for president.	0
1185	SANDERS	I love this country and my dad loved this country, and he was the most proud American because of what it gave him in terms of raising his family, even though we never had much money.	0
1186	SANDERS	But today in America, we are the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people, that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave.	0
1187	SANDERS	We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth.	0
1188	SANDERS	We are seeing millions of families unable to send their kids to college in the United States of America.	0
1189	SANDERS	I'm running for president because I believe it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.	0
1190	SANDERS	I do believe we need a political revolution where millions of people stand up and say loudly and clearly that our government belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.	0
1191	SANDERS	Thank you all.	0
1192	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
1193	TODD	Well, there you have it.	0
