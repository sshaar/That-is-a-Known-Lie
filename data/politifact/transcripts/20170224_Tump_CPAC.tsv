52	SYSTEM	[Laughter]	0
53	Donald Trump	But it gave me an idea.	0
54	Donald Trump	And I got a little bit concerned when I saw what was happening in the country.	0
55	Donald Trump	And I said, "Let's go to it."	0
56	Donald Trump	So, it was very exciting.	0
57	Donald Trump	I walked the stage on CPAC.	0
58	Donald Trump	I'll never forget it, really.	0
59	Donald Trump	I had very little notes and even less preparation.	0
60	Donald Trump	So when you have practically no notes and no preparation and then you leave and everybody was thrilled, I said, "I think I like this business."	0

64	Donald Trump	We wanted border security.	0
65	Donald Trump	We wanted very, very strong military. We wanted all of the things that we're going to get...	0

85	Donald Trump	The consultants that suck up all that money — oh, they suck it up.	0
86	Donald Trump	They're so good.	0
87	SYSTEM	[Laughter]	0
88	Donald Trump	They're not good at politics, but they're really good at sucking up people's money.	0
89	Donald Trump	Especially my opponents, because I kept them down to a minimum.	0
90	Donald Trump	But the consultants didn't think we would win.	0
91	Donald Trump	But they all underestimated the power of the people: You. And the people proved them...	0

100	Donald Trump	And I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news.	0
101	Donald Trump	It's fake, phony, fake.	0
102	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
103	Donald Trump	A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people.	0
104	Donald Trump	And they are.	0
105	Donald Trump	They are the enemy of the people.	0
106	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
107	Donald Trump	Because they have no sources, they just make 'em up when there are none.	0
108	Donald Trump	I saw one story recently where they said, "Nine people have confirmed."	0
109	Donald Trump	There're no nine people.	0
110	Donald Trump	I don't believe there was one or two people.	0
111	Donald Trump	Nine people.	0
112	Donald Trump	And I said, "Give me a break."	0
113	Donald Trump	Because I know the people, I know who they talk to.	0
114	Donald Trump	There were no nine people.	0
115	Donald Trump	But they say "nine people."	0
116	Donald Trump	And somebody reads it and they think, "Oh, nine people.	0
117	Donald Trump	They have nine sources."	0
118	Donald Trump	They make up sources.	0
119	Donald Trump	They're very dishonest people.	0
120	Donald Trump	In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people.	0
121	Donald Trump	The fake news.	0
122	Donald Trump	They dropped off the word "fake."	0
123	Donald Trump	And all of a sudden the story became the media is the enemy.	0
124	Donald Trump	They take the word "fake" out.	0
125	Donald Trump	And now I'm saying, "Oh no, this is no good."	0
126	Donald Trump	But that's the way they are.	0
127	Donald Trump	So I'm not against the media, I'm not against the press.	0
128	Donald Trump	I don't mind bad stories if I deserve them. And I tell ya, I love good stories, but we don't go...	0
129	SYSTEM	[Laughter]	0
130	Donald Trump	I don't get too many of them.	0
131	Donald Trump	But I am only against the fake news, media or press.	0
132	Donald Trump	Fake, fake.	0
133	Donald Trump	They have to leave that word.	0
134	Donald Trump	I'm against the people that make up stories and make up sources.	0
135	Donald Trump	They shouldn't be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody's name.	0
136	Donald Trump	Let their name be put out there.	0
137	Donald Trump	Let their name be put out.	0
138	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
139	Donald Trump	A source says that Donald Trump is a horrible, horrible human being.	0
140	Donald Trump	Let 'em say it to my face.	0
141	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
142	Donald Trump	Let there be no more sources.	0
143	Donald Trump	And remember this — and in not — in all cases.	0
144	Donald Trump	I mean, I had a story written yesterday about me in Reuters by a very honorable man.	0
145	Donald Trump	It was a very fair story.	0
146	Donald Trump	There are some great reporters around.	0
147	Donald Trump	They're talented, they're honest as the day is long.	0
148	Donald Trump	They're great.	0
149	Donald Trump	But there are some terrible dishonest people and they do a tremendous disservice to our country and to our people.	0
150	Donald Trump	A tremendous disservice.	0
151	Donald Trump	They are very dishonest people.	0
152	Donald Trump	And they shouldn't use sources.	0
153	Donald Trump	They should put the name of the person.	0
154	Donald Trump	You will see stories dry up like you've never seen before.	0
155	Donald Trump	So you have no idea how bad it is, because if you are not part of the story — and I put myself in your position sometimes.	0
156	Donald Trump	Because many of you, you're not part of the story.	0
157	Donald Trump	And if you're not part of the story, you know, then you, sort of, know — if you are part of the story, you know what they're saying is true or not.	0
158	Donald Trump	So when they make it up — and they make up something else, and you saw that before the election: polls, polls.	0
159	Donald Trump	The polls.	0
160	Donald Trump	They come out with these polls and everybody was so surprised.	0
161	Donald Trump	Actually, a couple polls got it right.	0
162	Donald Trump	I must say Los Angeles Times did a great job, shocking because, you know, they did a great job.	0
163	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
164	Donald Trump	And we had a couple of others that were right, but generally speaking, I mean, can tell you the network, somebody said a poll came out.	0
165	Donald Trump	And I say, what network is it?	0
166	Donald Trump	And they'll say, a certain — let's not even mention names, right?	0
167	Donald Trump	Shall we?	0
168	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
169	Donald Trump	Well, you have a lot of them.	0
170	Donald Trump	Look, the Clinton News Network is one.	0
171	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
172	Donald Trump	Totally.	0
173	Donald Trump	Take a look.	0
174	Donald Trump	Honestly.	0
175	Donald Trump	Take a look, honestly.	0
176	Donald Trump	Take a look at polls over the last two years.	0
177	Donald Trump	Now you'd think they would fire the pollster, right?	0
178	Donald Trump	After years and years of getting battered, but I — who knows, maybe they are just bad at polling or maybe they're not legit, but it's one or the other, look at how inaccurate — look at CBS, look at ABC, also, look at NBC, take a look at some of these polls.	0
179	Donald Trump	They're so bad, so inaccurate and what that does is it creates a false narrative.	0
180	Donald Trump	It creates like this narrative that is just like we're not going to win, people say, I love Trump, but you know, I'm not feeling great today, he can't win, so I won't go and vote.	0
181	Donald Trump	I won't go and vote.	0
182	Donald Trump	It creates a whole false deal.	0
183	Donald Trump	And we have to fight it, folks, we have to fight it.	0
184	Donald Trump	They're very smart, they're very cunning and they're very dishonest.	0
185	Donald Trump	So just to conclude, I mean, it's a very sensitive topic and they get upset when we expose their false stories.	0
186	Donald Trump	They say that we can't criticize their dishonest coverage because of the First Amendment, you know, they always bring up the First Amendment.	0
187	SYSTEM	[Laughter]	0
188	Donald Trump	And I love the First Amendment; nobody loves it better than me.	0
189	Donald Trump	Nobody.	0
190	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
191	Donald Trump	I mean, who use its more than I do?	0
192	Donald Trump	But the First Amendment gives all of us — it gives it to me, it gives it to you, it gives it to all Americans, the right to speak our minds freely.	0
193	Donald Trump	It gives you the right and me the right to criticize fake news and criticize it strongly.	0
194	SYSTEM	[Applause]	0
195	Donald Trump	And many of these groups are part the large media corporations that have their own agenda and it's not your agenda and it's not the country's agenda, it's their own agenda.	0
196	Donald Trump	They have a professional obligation as members of the press to report honestly.	0
197	Donald Trump	But as you saw throughout the entire campaign, and even now, the fake news doesn't tell the truth.	0
198	Donald Trump	Doesn't tell the truth.	0
199	Donald Trump	So just in finishing, I say it doesn't represent the people, it doesn't tell the never will represent the people, and we're going to do something about it because we have to go out and have to speak our minds and we have to be honest.	0
200	Donald Trump	Our victory was a win like nobody has ever seen before.	1

225	Donald Trump	Not that I'm a fan of Bernie, but a lot of Bernie people voted for Trump, you know why?	0
226	Donald Trump	Because he's right on one issue; trade.	0
227	Donald Trump	He was right about trade.	0
228	Donald Trump	Our country is being absolutely devastated with bad trade deals.	0
229	Donald Trump	So he was right about that, but we got a lot of Bernie support.	0
