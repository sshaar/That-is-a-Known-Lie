4	DICKERSON	The candidates for the Republican nomination are here in South Carolina for their ninth debate, one week before this state holds the first-in-the-South primary.	0
5	DICKERSON	George Washington wrote that the truth will ultimately prevail where there is pains taken to bring it to light.	0

19	DICKERSON	Now, as most of you have heard by now, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died today at the age of 79.	0
20	DICKERSON	He was the longest-serving member of the court, appointed by President Reagan in 1986.	0
21	DICKERSON	Justice Scalia was the court's leading conservative, and even those who disagreed with his opinions regarded him as a brilliant legal scholar.	0
22	DICKERSON	Please join us and the candidates on our stage in a moment of silence for Justice Antonin Scalia.	0
23	DICKERSON	Thank you.	0
24	DICKERSON	We will talk to the candidates about Justice Scalia and the road ahead when the debate begins in a moment.	0
25	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]	0
26	DICKERSON	Before we get started, candidates, here are the rules.	0
27	DICKERSON	When we ask you a question, you will have one minute to answer, and 30 seconds more if we ask a follow-up.	0
28	DICKERSON	If you're attacked by another candidate, you get 30 seconds to respond.	0
29	DICKERSON	And here's how we keep time.	0
30	DICKERSON	After we ask a question, you'll get a green light.	0
31	DICKERSON	The yellow light means you have 30 seconds left to finish your answer, and when time is up, the light turns red.	0
32	DICKERSON	That means please stop talking.	0
33	DICKERSON	If you keep talking, you'll hear this.	0
34	SYSTEM	[ bell rings ]	0
35	DICKERSON	You don't want to hear that.	0
36	DICKERSON	Joining me in the questioning tonight, my CBS News colleague, chief White House correspondent Major Garrett, and Kimberley Strassel, who is on the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal.	0
37	DICKERSON	And you can participate in the debate through our partnership with Twitter.	0
38	DICKERSON	Tweet us your questions and comments using the hashtag "#GOPDebate."	0
39	DICKERSON	So, let's begin.	0
40	DICKERSON	First, the death of Justice Scalia, and the vacancy that leaves on the Supreme Court.	0
41	DICKERSON	Mr. Trump, I want to start with you.	0
42	DICKERSON	You've said that the president shouldn't nominate anyone in the rest of his term to replace Justice Scalia.	0
43	DICKERSON	If you were president and had a chance, with 11 months left to go in your term, wouldn't it be an abdication, to conservatives in particular, not to name a conservative justice with the rest of your term?	0
44	TRUMP	Well, I can say this.	0
45	TRUMP	If the president, and if I were president now, I would certainly want to try and nominate a justice.	0
46	TRUMP	I'm sure that, frankly, I'm absolutely sure that President Obama will try and do it.	0
47	TRUMP	I hope that our Senate is going to be able — Mitch, and the entire group, is going to be able to do something about it.	0
48	TRUMP	In times of delay, we could have a Diane Sykes, or you could have a Bill Pryor — we have some fantastic people.	0
49	TRUMP	But this is a tremendous blow to conservatism.	0
50	TRUMP	It's a tremendous blow, frankly, to our country.	0
51	DICKERSON	So, just to be clear on this, Mr. Trump, you're O.K.	0
52	DICKERSON	with the president nominating somebody ...	0
53	TRUMP	...	0
54	TRUMP	I think he's going to do it whether or I'm O.K.	0
55	TRUMP	with it or not.	0
56	TRUMP	I think it's up to Mitch McConnell and everybody else to stop it.	0
57	TRUMP	It's called delay, delay, delay.	0
58	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
59	DICKERSON	Governor Kasich, I want to get your thoughts on this.	0
60	DICKERSON	Justice Scalia was a real believer, obviously, in the strict word of the Constitution.	0
61	DICKERSON	Now, Harry Reid says that a failure to fill his vacancy would be, quote, "shameful abdication of one of the Senate's most essential constitutional responsibilities."	0
62	DICKERSON	Where do you come down on this?	0
63	KASICH	Well, John, first of all, if I were president, we wouldn't have the divisions in the country we have today.	0
64	KASICH	I do want to take a second as we reflected on Judge Scalia, it's amazing — it's not even two minutes after the death of Judge Scalia, nine children here today, their father didn't wake up.	0
65	KASICH	His wife, sad, but I just wish we hadn't run so fast into politics.	0
66	KASICH	Here's my concern about this.	0
67	KASICH	The country is so divided right now, and now we're going to see another partisan fight take place.	0
68	KASICH	I really wish the president would think about not nominating somebody.	0
69	KASICH	If you were to nominate somebody, let's have him pick somebody that's going to have unanimous approval, and such widespread approval across the country that this could happen without a lot of recrimination.	0
70	KASICH	I don't think that's going to happen, and I would like the president just to, for once here, put the country first.	0
71	KASICH	We're going to have an election for president very soon, and the people will understand what is at stake in that election.	0
72	KASICH	And so I believe the president should not move forward, and I think that we ought to let the next president of the United States decide who is going to run that Supreme Court with a vote by the people of the United...	0
73	SYSTEM	[ bell rings ]	0
74	KASICH	...States of America.	0
75	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
76	DICKERSON	Dr. Carson.	0
77	DICKERSON	Dr. Carson, you, like others, put out a statement after the death was announced, and you said the president should delay.	0
78	DICKERSON	You've written a book on the Constitution recently.	0
79	DICKERSON	What does the Constitution say about whose duty it is here to act in this kind of a situation?	0
80	CARSON	Well, the current Constitution actually doesn't address that particular situation, but the fact of the matter is the Supreme Court, obviously, is a very important part of our governmental system.	0
81	CARSON	And when our Constitution was put in place, the average age of death was under 50, and therefore the whole concept of lifetime appointments for Supreme Court judges and federal judges was not considered to be a big deal.	0
82	CARSON	Obviously, that has changed, and it's something that probably needs to be looked at pretty carefully at some point.	0
83	CARSON	But, we need to start thinking about the divisiveness that is going on in our country.	0
84	CARSON	I looked at some of the remarks that people made after finding out that Justice Scalia had died, and they were truly nasty remarks.	0
85	CARSON	And that we have managed to get to that position in our country is truly a shame.	0
86	CARSON	And we should be thinking about how we could create some healing in this land.	0
87	CARSON	But, right now, we're not going to get healing with President Obama.	0
88	CARSON	That's very United Nations clear.	0
89	CARSON	So, I...	0
90	SYSTEM	[ bell rings ]	0
91	CARSON	... fully agree that we should not allow a judge to be appointed during his time.	0
92	DICKERSON	Senator Rubio, you're a...	0
93	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
94	DICKERSON	Senator Rubio, you're a lawyer.	0
95	DICKERSON	Quickly, can you address the issue of whether the Constitution tells us who has the power to appoint Supreme Court justices?	0
96	DICKERSON	And then, also, the Senate Republicans last year floated an idea of removing the filibuster for Senate — excuse me, for Supreme Court nominations.	0
97	DICKERSON	You seemed open to that.	0
98	DICKERSON	What's your feeling on that now?	0
99	RUBIO	Well, let me first talk about Justice Scalia.	0
100	RUBIO	His loss is tremendous, and obviously our hearts and prayers go out to his family.	0
101	RUBIO	He will go down as one of the great justices in the history of this republic.	0
102	RUBIO	You talk about someone who defended consistently the original meaning of the Constitution, who understood that the Constitution was not there to be interpreted based on the fads of the moment, but it was there to be interpreted according to its original meaning.	0
103	RUBIO	Justice Scalia understood that better than anyone in the history of this republic.	0
104	RUBIO	His dissent, for example, on the independent counsel case is a brilliant piece of jurist work.	0
105	RUBIO	And, of course, his dissent on Obergefell as well.	0
106	RUBIO	No.	0
107	RUBIO	2, I do not believe the president should appoint someone.	0
108	RUBIO	And it's not unprecedented.	0
109	RUBIO	In fact, it has been over 80 years since a lame duck president has appointed a Supreme Court justice.	0
110	RUBIO	And it remind us of this, how important this election is.	0
111	RUBIO	Someone on this stage will get to choose the balance of the Supreme Court, and it will begin by filling this vacancy that's there now.	0
112	RUBIO	And we need to put people on the bench that understand that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document.	0
113	RUBIO	It is to be interpreted as originally meant.	0
114	DICKERSON	Quickly, though, on this question...	0
115	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
116	DICKERSON	Very quickly, Senator, on this specific question, though.	0
117	DICKERSON	You were once in favor of dropping the threshold...	0
118	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]	0
119	RUBIO	That's not accurate.	0
120	DICKERSON	... majority — you were never in favor of that?	0
121	RUBIO	No, I've never — there has been, for example, today, according to the changes Harry Reid made, appellate judges can now be appointed by a simple majority, but not Supreme Court justices.	0
122	RUBIO	And I think today you see the wisdom of why we don't want that to change.	0
123	RUBIO	Because if that were the case and we were not in charge of the Senate, Harry Reid and Barack Obama would ram down our throat a liberal justice, like the ones Barack Obama has imposed on us already.	0
124	DICKERSON	O.K.	0
125	DICKERSON	Thank you, Senator.	0
126	DICKERSON	Governor Bush, I would like to ask you, conservatives for a long time have felt like that their Republican presidents have picked justices that didn't turn out to be real conservatives.	0
127	BUSH	Right.	0
128	DICKERSON	Bernie Sanders has said he would have a litmus test.	0
129	DICKERSON	He would make sure that he appointed a justice who was going to overturn Citizens United.	0
130	DICKERSON	If they can have a litmus test for a nominee, what about you?	0
131	DICKERSON	Would you have a litmus test for a nominee?	0
132	DICKERSON	And what would it be?	0
133	BUSH	Not on specific issues, not at all.	0
134	BUSH	I think the next president — if I'm president, I will appoint people — I'll nominate people that have a proven record in the judiciary.	0
135	BUSH	The problem in the past has been we have appointed people thinking you can get it through the Senate because they didn't have a record.	0
136	BUSH	And the problem is that sometimes we're surprised.	0
137	BUSH	The simple fact is the next president needs to appoint someone with a proven conservative record, similar to Justice Scalia, that is a lover of liberty, that believes in limited government, that consistently applied that kind of philosophy, that didn't try to legislator from the bench, that was respectful of the Constitution.	0
138	BUSH	And then fight and fight, and fight for that nomination to make sure that that nomination passes.	0
139	BUSH	Of course, the president, by the way, has every right to nominate Supreme Court justices.	0
140	BUSH	I'm an Article II guy in the Constitution.	0
141	BUSH	We're running for the president of the United States.	0
142	BUSH	We want a strong executive for sure.	0
143	BUSH	But in return for that, there should be a consensus orientation on that nomination, and there's no doubt in my mind that Barack Obama will not have a consensus pick when he submits that person to the Senate.	0
144	DICKERSON	Right, so, Senator Cruz, the Constitution...	0
145	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
146	DICKERSON	So, Senator Cruz, the Constitution says the president "shall appoint with advice and consent from the Senate," just to clear that up.	0
147	DICKERSON	So he has the constitutional power.	0
148	DICKERSON	But you don't think he should.	0
149	DICKERSON	Where do you set that date if you're president?	0
150	DICKERSON	Does it begin in election year, in December, November, September?	0
151	DICKERSON	And once you set the date, when you're president, will you abide by that date?	0
152	CRUZ	Well, we have 80 years of precedent of not confirming Supreme Court justices in an election year.	0
153	CRUZ	And let me say, Justice Scalia...	0
154	DICKERSON	Just can I — I'm sorry to interrupt, were any appointed in an election year, or is that just there were 80 years...	0
155	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]	0
156	CRUZ	Eighty years of not confirming.	0
157	CRUZ	For example, L.B.J.	0
158	CRUZ	nominated Abe Fortas.	0
159	CRUZ	Fortas did not get confirmed.	0
160	CRUZ	He was defeated.	0
161	DICKERSON	But Kennedy was confirmed in '88.	0
162	CRUZ	No, Kennedy was confirmed in '87...	0
163	DICKERSON	He was appointed in '87.	0
164	CRUZ	He was appointed in...	0
165	DICKERSON	... confirmed in '88.	0
166	DICKERSON	That's the question, is it appointing or confirming, what's the difference?	0
167	CRUZ	In this case it's both.	0
168	CRUZ	But if I could answer the question...	0
169	DICKERSON	Sorry, I just want to get the facts straight for the audience.	0
170	DICKERSON	But I apologize.	0
171	SYSTEM	[ booing and laughter ]	0
172	CRUZ	Justice Scalia was a legal giant.	0
173	CRUZ	He was somebody that I knew for 20 years.	0
174	CRUZ	He was a brilliant man.	0
175	CRUZ	He was faithful to the Constitution.	0
176	CRUZ	He changed the arc of American legal history.	0
177	CRUZ	And I'll tell you, his passing tonight, our prayers are with his family, with his wife, Maureen, who he adored, his nine children, his 36 grandkids.	0
178	CRUZ	But it underscores the stakes of this election.	0
179	CRUZ	We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will strike down every restriction on abortion adopted by the states.	0
180	CRUZ	We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will reverse the Heller decision, one of Justice Scalia's seminal decisions, that upheld the Second Amendment right to keep and to bear arms.	0
181	CRUZ	We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that would undermine the religious liberty of millions of Americans — and the stakes of this election, for this year, for the Senate, the Senate needs to stand strong and say, "We're not going to give up the U.S. Supreme Court for a generation by allowing Barack Obama to make one more liberal appointee."	0
182	CRUZ	And then for the state of South Carolina, one of the most important judgments for the men and women of South Carolina to make is who on this stage has the background, the principle, the character, the judgment and the strength of resolve to nominate and confirm principled constitutionalists to the court?	0
183	CRUZ	That will be what I will do if I'm elected president.	0
184	DICKERSON	All right.	0
185	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
186	DICKERSON	Thank you, Senator Cruz.	0
187	DICKERSON	All right, we're going to move on to national security here, and we are going to — I want to read a quote from Secretary Robert Gates, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who served for eight year — under eight presidents.	0
188	DICKERSON	And this is what he said about Republican candidates, quote, "Part of the concern that I have with the campaign is that the solutions being offered are so simplistic and so at odds with the way the world really works."	0
189	DICKERSON	So, in that spirit, we're going to work tonight to be more specific.	0
190	DICKERSON	Mr. Trump, I want to start with you.	0
191	DICKERSON	You have said as president, you'll get up to speed very quickly.	0
192	DICKERSON	You'll know more quickly as president than any of the experts.	0
193	DICKERSON	So, you've been elected president.	0
194	DICKERSON	It's your first day in the Situation Room.	0
195	DICKERSON	What three questions do you ask your national security experts about the world?	0
196	TRUMP	What we want to do, when we want to do it, and how hard do we want to hit?	0
197	TRUMP	Because we are going to have to hit very, very hard to knock out ISIS.	0
198	TRUMP	We're going to also have to learn who our allies are.	0
199	TRUMP	We have allies, so-called allies, we're spending billions and billions of dollars supporting people — we have no idea who they are in Syria.	0
200	TRUMP	Do we want to stay that route, or do we want to go and make something with Russia?	0
201	TRUMP	I hate to say Iran, but with Russia, because we — and the Iran deal is one of the worst deals I have ever seen negotiated in my entire life.	0
202	TRUMP	It's a disgrace that this country negotiated that deal.	0
203	TRUMP	But very important...	0
204	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
205	TRUMP	Not only a disgrace, it's a disgrace and an embarrassment.	0
206	TRUMP	But very important, who are we fighting with?	0
207	TRUMP	Who are we fighting for?	0
208	TRUMP	What are we doing?	0
209	TRUMP	We have to rebuild our country.	0
210	TRUMP	But we have to — I'm the only one on this stage that said: "Do not go into Iraq.	1
211	TRUMP	Do not attack Iraq."	0
212	TRUMP	Nobody else on this stage said that.	1
213	TRUMP	And I said it loud and strong.	0
214	TRUMP	And I was in the private sector.	0
215	TRUMP	I wasn't a politician, fortunately.	0
216	TRUMP	But I said it, and I said it loud and clear, "You'll destabilize the Middle East."	1
217	TRUMP	That's exactly what happened.	0
218	TRUMP	I also said, by the way, four years ago, three years ago, attack the oil, take the wealth away, attack the oil and keep the oil.	0
219	TRUMP	They didn't listen.	0
220	TRUMP	They just started that a few months ago.	0
221	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
222	DICKERSON	Senator Rubio — just 30 seconds on this question, Senator Rubio.	0
223	DICKERSON	Are those the questions you would ask?	0
224	RUBIO	No.	0
225	RUBIO	I think there are three major threats that you want to immediately get on top of.	0
226	RUBIO	No.	0
227	RUBIO	1 is, what are we doing in the Asia-Pacific region, where both North Korea and China pose threats to the national security of the United States.	0
228	RUBIO	No.	0
229	RUBIO	2 is, what are we doing in the Middle East with the combination of the Sunni-Shia conflict driven by the Shia arc that Iran is now trying to establish in the Middle East, also the growing threat of ISIS.	0
230	RUBIO	And the third is rebuilding and reinvigorating NATO in the European theater, particularly in Central Europe and in Eastern Europe, where Vladimir Putin is now threatening the territory of multiple countries, already controls 20 percent of Georgia and a significant percentage of Ukraine.	0
231	DICKERSON	Let me ask you a follow-up, a full, proper question, then.	0
232	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
233	DICKERSON	Violent extremists are operating or active in 40 countries.	0
234	DICKERSON	Some 80 countries are in different degrees of instability.	0
235	DICKERSON	And so, that's just the crises overseas.	0
236	DICKERSON	Barack Obama walked into an economic collapse when he came into office.	0
237	DICKERSON	We face international health crises, from Ebola to Zika.	0
238	DICKERSON	So, there is a lot of opportunity for crisis, as you have talked about.	0
239	DICKERSON	What would you point to in your past to show voters that you've been in a crisis and that you've been tested when that inevitable crisis comes when you're president?	0
240	RUBIO	Well, let me tell you what has happened a couple of years ago.	0
241	RUBIO	One of the hardest decisions you'll ever make in Congress is when you are asked by the president to authorize the use of force in a conflict, because you are now putting your name, on behalf of the people of your state, behind a military action, where Americans in uniform could lose their life.	0
242	RUBIO	So, in 2014, Barack Obama said he would not take military action against Assad unless it was authorized by the Senate, beginning on the Committee of Foreign Relations, where I am one of its members.	0
243	RUBIO	And it was hard because you looked at the pictures.	0
244	RUBIO	I saw the same images people saw.	0
245	RUBIO	I'm the father of children.	0
246	RUBIO	I saw the images of these little children — been gassed and poisoned by their own leaders, and we were angry.	0
247	RUBIO	Something had to happen, and there was the sense that we needed to seek retribution.	0
248	RUBIO	And then I looked at Barack Obama's plan.	0
249	RUBIO	Barack Obama's plan, which John Kerry later described as unbelievably small, and I concluded that that attack would not only not help the situation, it would make it actually worse.	0
250	RUBIO	It would allow Assad to stand up to the United States of America, survive a strike, stay in power and actually strengthen his grip.	0
251	RUBIO	So it was a difficult decision to make, and when we only had a few days to look at and make a decision on it, and I voted against Barack Obama's plan to use force, and it was the right decision.	0
252	DICKERSON	Dr. Carson, I want to ask you a question...	0
253	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
254	DICKERSON	Dr. Carson, you said you've had more 2 a.m. — 2 a.m. phone calls than anybody up on this stage.	0
255	DICKERSON	But when those 2 a.m. phone calls came, you operated on a foundation of all of that amazing medical work that you did, all of that learning.	0
256	DICKERSON	So if you were to be president, though, you wouldn't have the political foundation that hones those instincts when the 2 a.m. phone call comes.	0
257	DICKERSON	So isn't that a liability?	0
258	CARSON	No, it isn't.	0
259	CARSON	First of all, let me go back to your first question for me.	0
260	CARSON	It wasn't phrased as who gets to nominate Supreme Court appointees.	0
261	CARSON	Of course that's the president.	0
262	CARSON	So I know that there are some left-wing media who would try to make hay on that.	0
263	CARSON	Secondly, thank you for including me in the debate.	0
264	CARSON	Two questions already.	0
265	CARSON	This is great.	0
266	CARSON	Now, as far...	0
267	SYSTEM	[ laughter and applause ]	0
268	CARSON	...as far as those 2 a.m. phone calls are concerned, judgment is what is required.	0
269	CARSON	And the kinds of things that you come up with are sometimes very, very difficult and very unique.	0
270	CARSON	One of the things that I was known for is doing things that have not been done before.	0
271	CARSON	So no amount of experience really prepares you to do something that has never been done before.	0
272	CARSON	That's where judgment comes in.	0
273	CARSON	And that, I think, is a situation that we're in right now, a situation that we have never been in before with the kinds of threats that pose real danger to our nation, and it comes in very handy in those situations.	0
274	DICKERSON	Governor Kasich, Russia is being credited...	0
275	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
276	DICKERSON	...Russia is being credited with bombing U.S.-backed rebels on behalf of Assad in Aleppo and Syria.	0
277	DICKERSON	They've also moved into the Crimea, eastern Ukraine.	0
278	DICKERSON	You've said you want to punch them in the nose.	0
279	DICKERSON	What does that mean?	0
280	DICKERSON	What are you going to do?	0
281	KASICH	First of all — yes.	0
282	KASICH	First of all, look, we have to make it clear to Russia what we expect.	0
283	KASICH	We don't have to declare an enemy, rattle a sword or threaten, but we need to make it clear what we expect.	0
284	KASICH	No.	0
285	KASICH	1 is we will arm the folks in Ukraine who are fighting for their freedom.	0
286	KASICH	They deserve it.	0
287	KASICH	There will be no ifs, ands or buts about it.	0
288	KASICH	Secondly, an attack on NATO, trumped up on any excuse of Russian-speaking people, either in the NATO countries or in Finland or Sweden, is going to be an attack on us.	0
289	KASICH	And look, I think we have an opportunity as America to put something really great together again.	0

302	DICKERSON	You said defeating ISIS requires defeating Assad.	0
303	DICKERSON	But wouldn't that also put us into conflict with Russia, a country that supports Assad?	0
304	DICKERSON	So doesn't that mean, effectively, Assad's there to stay?	0
305	BUSH	No, it doesn't, and that's the problem.	0
306	BUSH	The lack of leadership in this country by Barack Obama, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, thinking that this is a policy that works, this policy of containment with ISIS.	0
307	BUSH	It's a complete, unmitigated disaster.	0
308	BUSH	And to allow Russia now to have influence in Syria makes it harder, but we need to destroy ISIS and dispose of Assad to create a stable Syria so that the four million refugees aren't a breeding ground for Islamic jihadists.	0
309	BUSH	This is the problem.	0

391	SYSTEM	[ laughter and applause ]	0
392	DICKERSON	Senator Cruz, you talked about the first Gulf War as being a kind of model for your focused and determined effort to go after ISIS.	0
393	DICKERSON	But there were 700,000 ground troops as a part of that, and you don't have a ground component to your plan.	0
394	DICKERSON	Why?	0
395	CRUZ	Well, we need to focus on what the objective is, you know?	0
396	CRUZ	Your question about the first three questions you would ask in this Situation Room.	0
397	CRUZ	I think it is a problem if the president, commander in chief, we've elected does not have the experience and background to understand the threats facing this country coming in on Day 1.	0
398	CRUZ	If you look at the threats facing this country, the single gravest threat, national security threat, is the threat of a nuclear Iran.	0
399	CRUZ	That's why I've pledged on Day 1 to rip to shreds this Iranian nuclear deal, and anyone that thinks you can negotiate Khamenei does not understand the nature of Khamenei.	0
400	CRUZ	When it comes to ISIS, we've got to have a focused objective.	0
401	CRUZ	One of the problems of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's foreign policy, and, sadly, too many establishment Republicans in Washington, is they focus on issues unrelated to protecting this country.	0
402	CRUZ	They focus on nation building, they focus on toppling governments to promote democracy, and it ends up undermining our national security.	0
403	CRUZ	Now, with regard to ISIS, we need a commander in chief that sets the objective we will utterly defeat them because they have declared war.	0
404	CRUZ	They've declared a jihad on us.	0
405	CRUZ	Now, what do we need...	0
406	SYSTEM	[ bell rings ]	0
407	CRUZ	...to carry that out.	0
408	CRUZ	We need overwhelming air power, we need to arm the Kurds, who can be our boots on the ground, and if ground troops are necessary, then we should employ them, but it shouldn't be politicians demonstrating political toughness.	0
409	CRUZ	It should be military expert judgment carrying out the objectives set out by the commander in chief.	0
410	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
411	DICKERSON	Very quickly, 30-second follow-up.	0
412	DICKERSON	You've said that, essentially, the Kurds would be the American ground forces in there.	0
413	DICKERSON	The criticism that experts have on that is that the Kurds only can work within their territory.	0
414	DICKERSON	If they take larger amounts of territory, you have an ethnic war with the Arabs.	0
415	DICKERSON	So the Kurds can't really do as much as you seem to be putting on their backs.	0
416	CRUZ	We have Kurds in both Iraq and Syria.	0
417	CRUZ	They are fighting ISIS right now.	0
418	CRUZ	They are winning victories right now.	0
419	CRUZ	ISIS is using American military equipment they've seized in Iraq.	0
420	CRUZ	And the Obama administration refuses to arm the Kurds, the pesh merga, the fighting forces who have been longtime allies.	0
421	CRUZ	We ought to be arming them and letting them fight.	0
422	CRUZ	Now, if we need to embed Special Forces to direct our overwhelming air power, if it is required to use ground troops to defeat ISIS, we should use them, but we ought to start with using our incredible air power advantage.	0
423	CRUZ	The first Persian Gulf War, we launched 1,100 air attacks a day.	0
424	CRUZ	Today, we're launching between 15 and 30.	0
425	CRUZ	We're not using the tools we have, and it's because the commander in chief is not focused on defeating the enemy.	0

560	DICKERSON	A moment of pause here.	0
561	DICKERSON	You have said, Dr. Carson, that — referring to yourself, that people bought into the idea that, quote, "A nice person can't be tough on terrorists."	0
562	DICKERSON	You have called for loosening the rules of engagement for the military, which could lead to more civilian casualties.	0
563	DICKERSON	So, explain why those casualties would be acceptable in the fight against ISIS?	0
564	CARSON	Well, first of all, let me just address the Iraq question.	0
565	CARSON	You know, I was not particularly in favor of us going to war in Iraq, primarily because I have studied, you know, the Middle East, recognizing that those are nations that are ruled by dictators and have been for thousands of years.	0
566	CARSON	And when you go in and you remove one of those dictators, unless you have an appropriate plan for replacing them, you're going to have chaos.	0
567	CARSON	Now, fortunately, we were able to stabilize the situation, and it was the current administration that turned tail and ran and destabilized the situation.	0
568	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
569	CARSON	Now, having said that, in terms of the rules of engagement, I was talking about, you know, Obama has said, you know, we shouldn't bomb tankers, you know, coming out of refineries because there may be people in there, or because the environment may be hurt.	0
570	CARSON	You know, that's just asinine thinking.	0

602	TRUMP	We have 2.5 trillion that I think is actually five trillion because the government has no idea when they say 2.5, they have no idea what they're doing or saying, as they've proven very well.	0

635	GARRETT	Senator Cruz.	0
636	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
637	GARRETT	John mentioned this is about dollars and incentives.	0
638	GARRETT	We also want to talk about economic growth engagements.	0
639	GARRETT	You have proposed a consumption tax, you called it the "back tax."	0
640	GARRETT	Some analysts compare it more to an attributed "value-added tax."	0
641	GARRETT	From the perspective from economic growth in building wages, how does that work, and how would you address those longstanding conservative concerns that something approaching the "value-added tax" would be used to constantly increase those rates to pay for future government spending and become an escalator of taxation, not of growth?	0
642	CRUZ	Well, let me say it at the outset that everyone here understands — everyone understands that how — that the middle class has been left behind in the last seven years of the Obama economy, and we've got to bring jobs back.	0
643	CRUZ	We've got to get people back to work.	0
644	CRUZ	We've got to get wages going up again.	0
645	CRUZ	We've got to get people moving from part-time work to full-time work.	0
646	CRUZ	We all agree on that, but it's not going to be solved with magic pixie dust.	0
647	CRUZ	It's just going to be solved by declaring into the air, "Let there be jobs."	0
648	CRUZ	We actually have to understand the principles that made America great in the first place.	0
649	CRUZ	Now, where do you get economic growth?	0
650	CRUZ	If you look at cause and effect over our nation's history, every time we lessen the burden of Washington on small-business owners, on job creators, we see incredible economic growth.	0
651	CRUZ	You do that through tax reform and regulatory reform.	0
652	CRUZ	My tax plan — typical family of four, first $36,000 you earn, you pay nothing in taxes — no income taxes, no payroll taxes, no nothing.	0
653	CRUZ	Above 10 percent, everyone pays the same simple, flat 10 percent income rate.	0
654	CRUZ	It's flat and fair.	0
655	CRUZ	You can fill out your taxes on a postcard, and we abolish the I.R.S.	0
656	CRUZ	If you want to see the postcard, I've got it on my website.	0
657	GARRETT	Now, the question — conservatives have sort of this idea conceptually for a long time, but especially on this consumption value-added tax system.	0
658	GARRETT	In Europe, where it exists, it has become an escalator of taxation to feed government spending, and that's why conservatives have long resisted it.	0
659	GARRETT	Why and what would you do as president to make sure that doesn't happen?	0
660	CRUZ	Now, Major, the business flat tax that is in my tax plan is not a VAT.	0
661	CRUZ	A VAT in Europe is a sales tax.	0
662	CRUZ	The business flat tax is not a sales tax, it is a tax of 16 percent opposed fairly and evenly across the board on all business.	0
663	CRUZ	One of the things that's critical is we're doing that in conjunction with abolishing the corporate income tax, with abolishing the Obamacare taxes, with abolishing the payroll taxes, which are the biggest taxes paid by most working Americans, and with abolishing the death tax, which is cruel and unfair.	0
664	CRUZ	And you asked about economic growth — the nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimated a simple flat tax that would produce 4.9 million new jobs, it would increase capital investment by 44 percent and would lift everyone's income by double digits.	0
665	CRUZ	That's how you turn the country around, not just hoping and praying for it, but implementing policies that work.	0
666	STRASSEL	O.K., I have a question, a related tax question.	0
667	STRASSEL	Senator Rubio, you have the highest tax rate of anyone up on the stage in terms of the top tax rates, 35 percent.	0
668	STRASSEL	Some economists say, "It would limit its potential to boost economic growth."	0
669	STRASSEL	You do that so that you will have more revenue to pay for a tripling of the Child Tax Credit.	0
670	STRASSEL	Normally, it's liberals who like to use the tax code to insert social policy.	0
671	STRASSEL	Why should conservatives who want to tax adopt the other side's approach?	0
672	RUBIO	Well, because I'm influencing social policy — this is their money.	0
673	RUBIO	This is the money of parents.	0
674	RUBIO	You don't earn the tax credit unless you're working.	0
675	RUBIO	That's your money, it doesn't belong to government.	0
676	RUBIO	Here's what I don't understand.	0
677	RUBIO	If a business takes their money and they invest in the piece of the equipment, they get to write off their taxes.	0
678	RUBIO	But if a parent takes money that they have earned to work and invests in their children, they don't?	0
679	RUBIO	This makes no sense.	0
680	RUBIO	Parenting is the most important job any of us will ever have.	0
681	RUBIO	Family formation is the most important thing in society.	0
682	RUBIO	So what my tax plan does, is it does create, especially for working families, an additional Child Tax Credit.	0
683	RUBIO	So that parents who are working get to keep more of their own money, not the government's money, to invest in their children to go to school, to go to a private school, to buy a new backpack.	0
684	RUBIO	Let me tell you, if you're a parent that's struggling, then you know that $50 a month is the difference between a new pair of shoes this month or not getting a new pair of shoes for your kids.	0
685	RUBIO	I'm going to have a tax plan that is pro-family, because the family is the most important institution in society.	0
686	RUBIO	You cannot have a strong country without strong families.	0

688	STRASSEL	Governor Kasich, this on is on size of government.	0
689	STRASSEL	In 2013, you pushed through a Medicaid reform in your state over the rejections of many of the Republicans in your state.	0
690	STRASSEL	Total enrollment and overall cost of program have gone well beyond what anyone had expected, including yourself.	0
691	STRASSEL	How can you argue that this overall growth fits in with conservative ambition to significantly cut back on the size of federal welfare programs?	0
692	KASICH	Yeah.	0
693	KASICH	Well, first of all, those numbers, incorrect.	0
694	KASICH	We are — our Medicaid programs are coming in below cost estimates, and our Medicaid program in the second year grew at 2.5 percent.	0
695	KASICH	And Kimberley, let me tell you, when we expand Medicaid and we treat the mentally ill, then they don't live under a bridge or live in a prison, where they cost $22,500 a year.	0
696	KASICH	When we take the drug addicted and we treat them in the prisons, we stop the revolving door of people in and out of prisons, and we save $22,500 a year.	0
697	KASICH	Guess what else?	0
698	KASICH	They get their lives back.	0
699	KASICH	And the working poor, they're now getting health care.	0
700	KASICH	And you know that about a third of the people who are now getting that health care are people who are suffering very serious illnesses, particularly cancer.	0
701	KASICH	So, what I would tell you is, we've gone from an $8 billion hole to a $2 billion surplus.	0
702	KASICH	We've cut taxes by more than any governor in America by $5 billion.	0
703	KASICH	We have grown the number of jobs by 400,000 private-sector jobs since I've been governor.	0
704	KASICH	Our credit is strong.	0
705	KASICH	Our pensions are strong.	0
706	KASICH	And frankly, we leave no one behind.	0
707	KASICH	Economic growth is not an end unto itself.	0
708	KASICH	We want everyone to rise, and we will make them personally responsible for the help that they get.	0

715	BUSH	Look, I admire the fact that Governor Kasich is supporting spending more money on drug treatment and mental health.	0
716	BUSH	I think that's a high priority all across this country, but expanding Obamacare is what we're talking about, and Obamacare's expansion, even though the federal government is paying for the great majority of it, is creating further debt on the backs of our children and grandchildren.	0
717	BUSH	We should be fighting Obamacare, repealing Obamacare, replacing it with something totally different.	0

722	BUSH	A committed speaker of the House asked me to go as a private citizen to make the case against the expansion.	0
723	BUSH	I did, and it wasn't expanded there, just as it wasn't expanded in South Carolina under Governor Haley.	0

726	KASICH	Yeah, let me say a couple of things.	0
727	KASICH	First of all, when Jeb was governor, his first four years as governor, he expand — his Medicaid program grew twice as fast as mine.	0
728	KASICH	O.K.?	0
729	KASICH	It's just a fact.	0
730	KASICH	Now, with Obamacare, I've not only sued the administration, I did not set up an exchange.	0
731	KASICH	And he knows that I'm not for Obamacare, never have been.	0
732	KASICH	But here's what's interesting about Medicaid.	0
733	KASICH	You know who expanded Medicaid five times to try to help the folks and give them opportunity so that you could rise and get a job?	0
734	KASICH	President Ronald Reagan.	0
735	KASICH	Now, the fact of the matter is, we expanded to get people on their feet, and once they're on their feet, we are giving them the training and the efforts that they need to be able to get work and pull out of that situation.	0
736	GARRETT	Understood, Governor Kasich.	0
737	KASICH	That's what we're doing in our state.	0
738	BUSH	South Carolina — South Carolinians need to know this, because the Cato Institute, which grades governors based on their spending, rank him right at the bottom.	0

767	SYSTEM	[ applause ]	0
768	GARRETT	Governor Bush, from the perspective, economic growth — viewed from this perspective of economic growth, you have proposed a tax on hedge fund managers.	0
769	GARRETT	The Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative tax group you're probably aware of, has said no Republican should be for higher taxes on capital gains.	0
770	GARRETT	And many conservatives wonder if this proposal of yours would undermine not only that philosophy, but undercut your projection of 4 percent economic growth annually under your presidency?	0
771	BUSH	Of course not.	0
772	BUSH	It won't have an impact on hedge funds managers paying ordinary income.	0
773	BUSH	In fact, it's not just hedge fund people, but people that are doing — they're in the business of investing other people's money, getting capital gains treatment is not appropriate.	0
774	BUSH	They should be paying ordinary income.	0
775	BUSH	That's their business.	0
776	BUSH	They're grateful to be able to make a lot of money, I'm sure.	0
777	BUSH	And what we do is lower the rates.	0
778	BUSH	It's not the end of the world that private equity people and hedge fund folks that are, right now, getting capital gains treatment for the income they earn, pay ordinary income like everybody else in this room.	0
779	BUSH	That's not a problem at all.	0
780	BUSH	What we need to do is reform the tax code to simplify the rates, to shift power away from Washington, D.C. That's what I did as governor of the state of Florida, $19 billion dollars of tax cuts, and it stimulated seven out of the eight years.	0
781	BUSH	Florida led the nation in job growth.	0

785	CARSON	Bencarson.com, go read about it, because my tax plan has been praised by Cato, by Wall Street Journal.	0
786	CARSON	Forbes said it is the best, the most pro-growth tax plan, and it's based on real fairness for everybody.	0
787	CARSON	Starts at the 150 percent poverty level, but even the people below that have to pay something, because everybody has to have skin in the game, and the millions of people can't, you know, talk about what other people have to pay and have no skin in the game.	0

802	DICKERSON	But before I turn it back to Major Garrett and Kim Strassel, I have one question for Mr. Trump.	0
803	DICKERSON	Mr. Trump, in the Republican National Committee's Spanish-language response to the State of the Union, Congressman Diaz-Balart said, quote, "It's essential that we find a legislative solution," talking about immigration, "to offer a permanent and humane solution to those who live in the shadows.	0
804	DICKERSON	What does that mean to you, "a humane solution to those who live in the shadows"?	0

824	GARRETT	For the purposes of the lines — lines you would draw legislatively as a president on immigration reform, define amnesty.	0
825	RUBIO	Well, first of all, I think amnesty is the forgiveness of a wrongdoing without consequence and that — I've never supported that.	0
826	RUBIO	I do not support that.	0
827	RUBIO	I think there has to be consequences for violating our immigration laws.	0
828	RUBIO	What I think is clear about this issue to begin with is we're not going to be able to make progress on illegal immigration until first, illegal immigration is brought under control.	0
829	RUBIO	You go back to 1986, when they legalized three million people and they promised to secure the border.	0
830	RUBIO	It didn't happen, and as a result, people have lost trust in the federal government.	0
831	RUBIO	It is now clear that the only way to make progress on immigration is not just to pass a law that enforces the law, but actually prove to people that it's working.	0
832	RUBIO	They want to see the wall built.	0
833	RUBIO	They want to see the additional border agents.	0
834	RUBIO	They want to see E-Verify.	0
835	RUBIO	They want to see an entry-exit tracking system.	0
836	RUBIO	Forty percent of the people in this country illegally are entering legally and overstaying visas.	0
837	RUBIO	And only after all of that is in place, then we'll see what the American people are willing to support on this issue.	0
838	RUBIO	I think the American people will be very reasonable, but responsible, about how you handle someone who has been here a long time, who can pass a background check, who pays a fine and starts paying taxes and all they want is a work permit.	0
839	RUBIO	But you can't do any of that until you prove to people that illegal immigration is under control once and for all.	0

850	CRUZ	But as voters, we've been burned over and over again by people that give us a great campaign speech and they don't walk the walk.	0
851	CRUZ	There are sharp differences on amnesty.	0

938	BUSH	That is the better approach.	0

1220	DICKERSON	I understand, you're on deck, governor.	0
1221	BUSH	Also, he talked about one of my heroes, Ronald Reagan.	0
1222	BUSH	Ronald Reagan was a liberal maybe in the 1950s.	0
1223	BUSH	He was a conservative reformed governor for eight years before he became president, and no one should suggest he made an evolution for political purposes.	0
1224	BUSH	He was a conservative, and he didn't tear down people like Donald Trump is.	0
1225	BUSH	He tore down the Berlin Wall.	0

1247	CRUZ	Because his entire life, he support liberals from Jimmy Carter, to Hillary Clinton, to John Kerry.	0

1258	RUBIO	I do.	0
1259	BUSH	That was me.	0
1260	RUBIO	I had something important.	0
1261	DICKERSON	You're on deck, sir.	0
1262	RUBIO	The issue of poverty is critical, because for me, poverty is the — is — is free enterprise not reaching people.	0
1263	RUBIO	Today, we have antipoverty programs that don't cure poverty.	0
1264	RUBIO	We don't cure poverty in America.	0
1265	RUBIO	Our antipoverty programs have become, in some instances, a way of life, a lifestyle.	0
1266	RUBIO	Now, we do need antipoverty programs, you can't have free enterprise programs without them, but not as a way of life.	0
1267	RUBIO	And so I have a very specific proposal on this and I don't — in 60 seconds, I can't describe it all, but it basically turns the program over to states.	0
1268	RUBIO	It allows states to design innovative programs that cure poverty, because I think Nikki Haley will do a better job curing poverty than Barack Obama.	0

1271	DICKERSON	One thing you left off was — was immigration reform.	0
1272	DICKERSON	Is it the case that in your list of accomplishments you can't mention that?	0
1273	RUBIO	Well, no.	0
1274	RUBIO	It's not the case.	0
1275	RUBIO	It didn't pass, and we haven't solved immigration in this country.	0
1276	RUBIO	It's still a problem.	0
1277	RUBIO	It is worse today than it was three years ago, which is worse than it was five years ago.	0
1278	RUBIO	And it has to be confronted and solved.	0
1279	RUBIO	But the only way forward on this issue — you asked a question about flexibility.	0
1280	RUBIO	Let me tell you about that.	0
1281	RUBIO	One of the things that you need in leadership is the ability to understand that to get things done, you must figure out the way to get it done.	0
1282	RUBIO	You will not pass comprehensive immigration reform.	0
1283	RUBIO	People do not trust the federal government.	0
1284	RUBIO	They want to see the law being enforced.	0

1288	RUBIO	They want to see all of these things working, and then they will have a conversation with you about what do you do with people that have been here a long time that are otherwise, you know, not criminals.	0

1299	CARSON	Is that really what you want?	0
1300	CARSON	What we just saw?	0
1301	CARSON	I don't think so.	0
1302	CARSON	And you know, I — when I got into this race, I decided to look under the hood of the engine of what runs Washington, D.C., and my first inclination was to run away, but I didn't do it because I'm thinking about our children and the fact that we are the United States of America.	0
1303	CARSON	And anybody up here is going to be much better than what's going to come on the other side.	0
1304	CARSON	And what happened tonight with — with Justice Scalia tells you that we cannot afford to lose this election, and we cannot be tearing each other down.	0

1306	DICKERSON	Dr. Carson, I — let me ask you a different question.	0
1307	DICKERSON	When you were — you were the first one, really, to talk about political correctness.	0
1308	DICKERSON	Everybody now talks about it, but that was really what sparked your — your rise.	0
1309	DICKERSON	Politicians are often accused of glossing over any hard choices people have to make, just always selling happy, nice things.	0
1310	DICKERSON	So in the — in the spirit of saying something that might be politically incorrect, tell the voters something that they need to hear but that might be politically incorrect?	0
1311	CARSON	Well, first of all, I'm not a politician, so I'm never going to become a politician.	0
1312	CARSON	But here's what — here's what people need to know.	0
1313	CARSON	People need to know that free college is not — it's a non-starter.	0
1314	CARSON	You know, you have to look at our economic situation.	0
1315	CARSON	We're on the verge of economic collapse and, you know, we're — it's not just the $19 trillion, but it's also the $200 trillion in unfunded liabilities.	0
1316	CARSON	What we need to think about is, what does that do to the average person?	0
1317	CARSON	When we have a debt of that nature, it causes the Fed to change their policy, it causes the central bank to keep the — the rates low, and who does does that affect?	0
1318	CARSON	Mr. Average, who used to go to the bank every Friday and put part of his check in the bank and watch it grow over three decades and be able to retire with a nice nest egg, that's gone.	0
1319	CARSON	That part of the American dream is gone.	0
1320	CARSON	All of these things are disappearing, and Bernie Sanders and people like Hillary Clinton blame it on the rich.	0
1321	CARSON	They say those evil rich people, if we take their money we can solve the problem.	0
1322	CARSON	It's not the evil rich people.	0
1323	CARSON	It's the irresponsible, evil government.	0

1327	DICKERSON	You talked about in New Hampshire, Democrats would come up to you and say, "I hope you win."	0
1328	DICKERSON	Why will that help you win a Republican nomination?	0
1329	KASICH	You know, John, I think all people are the same.	0
1330	KASICH	Look, I did 106 town halls, and I've been doing them left and right here in South Carolina.	0
1331	KASICH	The first thing we have to do is grow the economy, and I know the formula because I was chairman in Washington when we balanced the budget and created so many jobs, and the same that we've been able to do in Ohio.	0
1332	KASICH	You need common-sense regulations so small business can flourish, you need lower taxes both on business and individuals, and you need a fiscal plan to be able to get ourselves in a situation where people can predict a little bit about the future when it comes to the fiscal issues.	0
1333	KASICH	And when you have that formula, combined with work force that's trained, you can explode the economy and create many jobs.	0
1334	KASICH	I have done it twice, and I want to go back to Washington and do it again.	0
1335	KASICH	John, the thing is, is I think that there are people now, these blue-collar Democrats — my dad was a blue-collar Democrat — the Democratic Party has left them.	0
1336	KASICH	When they're arguing about being socialists, they've left — they have lost those blue-collar Democrats.	0
1337	KASICH	And you know what I think they get out of me — is my sense of what they get out of me, and it's embarrassment about campaigns, you brag about yourself.	0
1338	KASICH	But I think I'm a uniter, I think people sense it.	0
1339	KASICH	I think they know I have the experience, and that I'm a man that can give people hope and a sense that they have the opportunity rise.	0
1340	KASICH	And I'll tell you, I love these blue-collar Democrats, because they're going to vote for us come next fall, promise you that.	0

1344	DICKERSON	You don't necessarily seem like somebody who has somebody who tells you you're wrong a lot.	0
1345	DICKERSON	Can you tell us of an instance where somebody has said, "Donald Trump, you're wrong," and you listened to them?	0

1379	TRUMP	Well, I'll tell you — over the years, I've made many speeches.	0
1380	TRUMP	People have asked me, big companies have asked me to make speeches, and friends of mine that run big companies on success.	0
1381	TRUMP	And occasion, in order to sort of really highlight something, I'll use a profanity.	0
1382	TRUMP	One of the profanities that I got credited with using, that I didn't use, was a very bad word, two weeks ago, that I never used.	0
1383	TRUMP	I said, "You."	0
1384	TRUMP	And everybody said "Oh, he didn't say anything wrong."	0
1385	TRUMP	But you bleeped it, so everyone thinks I said the — I didn't say anything.	0
1386	TRUMP	I never said the word.	0
1387	TRUMP	It is very unfair, that criticism.	0
1388	TRUMP	Now, I will say this, with all of that being said, I have said I will not do it at all, because if I say a word that's a little bit off color, a little bit, it ends up being a headline.	0

1401	DICKERSON	Do you still feel that way?	0
1402	BUSH	I think the dysfunction in Washington is really dangerous, that's what I think.	0
1403	BUSH	And we need a proven leader that has a record of solving problems, someone who doesn't cut and run; someone who could be a commander in chief to unite our country around common purposes; someone who doesn't disparage people.	0
1404	BUSH	Someone that doesn't brag, for example, that he has been bankrupt four times and it was great, because he could use the legal system.	0

1480	RUBIO	This is the worst president we've had in 35 years, 35 years back would have made it Jimmy Carter.	0
1481	RUBIO	That's what Ronald Reagan inherited.	0
1482	RUBIO	And I think the question you would ask is, how did you inspire again the American people to believe in the future?	0
1483	RUBIO	How did you — what did it take to ensure that the American people, despite all of the difficulties of the time — you know, you look back at that time, the American military was in decline.	0

1508	KASICH	You know, the Lord made all of us special.	0
1509	KASICH	The Lord wants us to be connected.	0
1510	KASICH	I believe we're part of a very big mosaic.	0
1511	KASICH	And I'll send the power back.	0
1512	KASICH	And whoever gets elected president here, hopefully will take care of the issue of jobs and wages and Social Security and the border.	0
1513	KASICH	But the spirit of the America rests in all of us.	0
1514	KASICH	It's in our guts.	0
1515	KASICH	It's taking care of our children.	0
1516	KASICH	It's taking care of the lady next door who just lost her husband.	0
1517	KASICH	It's fixing the schools where we live and telling kids to stay off drugs.	0
1518	KASICH	You see, I think what the Lord wants is for to us engage, and in America, the spirit of America doesn't come from the top down.	0
1519	KASICH	The spirit of America rests in us.	0
1520	KASICH	And I want to call on everyone in America to double down and realize that you were made special to heal this country and lift it for everyone.	0
1521	KASICH	Thank you all very much.	0
1522	KASICH	And I hope I can have your vote in South Carolina.	0

1524	DICKERSON	Dr. Carson — Dr. Carson, you're next.	0
1525	CARSON	This is the first generation not expected to do better than their parents.	0
1526	CARSON	Some people say it's the new normal, but there's nothing normal about it in an exceptional American.	0
1527	CARSON	I, like you, am a member of we, the people, and we know that our country is heading off the cliff.	0
1528	CARSON	Joseph Stalin said if you want to bring America down you, have to undermine three things: our spiritual life, our patriotism and our morality.	1
1529	CARSON	We, the people, can stop that decline, starting right here in South Carolina.	0
1530	CARSON	If all the people who say, "I love Ben Carson and his policies, but he can't win," vote for me, not only can we win, but we can turn this thing around.	0
1531	CARSON	You know, we have this manipulation by the political class and by the media telling us who we're supposed to pick and how we're supposed to live.	0
1532	CARSON	We, the people, are the only people who will determine that.	0
1533	CARSON	And if you elect me as your next president, I promise you that you will get somebody who is accountable to everybody and beholden to no one.	0
1534	CARSON	Thank you.	0

1538	BUSH	The next president is going to be confronted with an unforeseen challenge.	0
1539	BUSH	That's almost certain.	0
1540	BUSH	It could be a pandemic, a major natural disaster or an attack on our country.	0
1541	BUSH	The question for South Carolinians and Americans is who do you want to have sitting behind the big desk in the Oval Office?	0
1542	BUSH	Because that's the question.	0
1543	BUSH	It's not the things we're talking about today.	0
1544	BUSH	It's the great challenge that may happen.	0
1545	BUSH	I believe I will have a steady hand as commander in chief and president of the United States.	0
1546	BUSH	I will unite this country around common purposes because I did it as governor of the state of Florida.	0
1547	BUSH	When I was governor, we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in 16 months.	0
1548	BUSH	Our state was on its back.	0
1549	BUSH	We recovered far faster than what people thought because we led.	0
1550	BUSH	We want to challenge rather than cutting and running.	0
1551	BUSH	That's what we need in Washington, D.C. We need someone with a servant's heart that has a backbone, that isn't going to focus on polls and focus groups.	0
1552	BUSH	The focus will be on the American people to keep them safe and secure.	0
1553	BUSH	I ask for your vote next Saturday.	0

1560	RUBIO	Our culture's in trouble.	0
1561	RUBIO	Wrong is considered right and right is considered wrong.	0
1562	RUBIO	All the things that once held our families together are now under constant assault.	0
1563	RUBIO	And around the world, America's reputation is in decline.	0
1564	RUBIO	Our allies don't trust us, our adversaries don't fear us, Iran captures our sailors and parades them before the world on video.	0
1565	RUBIO	These are difficult times, but 2016 can be a turning point.	0
1566	RUBIO	That's why I'm running for president, and that's why I'm here today to ask you for your vote.	0
1567	RUBIO	If you elect me president, we are going to re-embrace free enterprise so that everyone can go as far as their talent and their work will take them.	0
1568	RUBIO	We are going to be a country that says that "life begins at conception and life is worthy of the protection of our laws."	0
1569	RUBIO	We're going to be a country that says "that marriage is between one man and one woman."	0
1570	RUBIO	We are going to be a country that says, "The constitution and the rights that it talks about do not come from our president, they come from our creator."	0
1571	RUBIO	We are going to be loyal to our allies like Israel, not enemies like Iran.	0
1572	RUBIO	And we will rebuild the U.S. military so no one will there test it.	0

1574	RUBIO	I will unify this party.	0

1580	CRUZ	South Carolina, you have a critical choice to make.	0
1581	CRUZ	Our country literally hangs in the balance.	0
1582	CRUZ	Do you want another Washington deal maker who will do business as usual, cut deals with the Democrats, grow government, grow debt and give up our fundamental liberties?	0
1583	CRUZ	Or do you want a conservative, a proven conservative that will stand and fight with you each and every day?	0
1584	CRUZ	Listen, repealing Obamacare is not going to be easy.	0
1585	CRUZ	Passing a simple flat tax that abolishes the I.R.S.	0
1586	CRUZ	is not going to be easy, but if we stand with the American people, we can do it.	0
1587	CRUZ	And today, we saw just how great the stakes are.	0
