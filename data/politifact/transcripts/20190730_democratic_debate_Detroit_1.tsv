1	TAPPER	Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate candidates.	0
2	TAPPER	We’re about to begin opening statements.	0
3	TAPPER	But first, a review of the ground rules that your campaigns agreed to earlier this month to ensure a fair debate.	0
4	TAPPER	As moderators, we will attempt to guide the discussion.	0
5	TAPPER	You will each receive one minute to answer questions, 30 seconds for responses and rebuttals and 15 additional seconds if a moderator asks for a clarification.	0
6	TAPPER	The timing lights will remind you of these limits.	0
7	TAPPER	Please respect that and please refrain from interrupting your fellow candidates during their allotted time.	0
8	TAPPER	A candidate infringing on another candidate's time will have his or her time reduced.	0
9	TAPPER	We also want to ask our audience inside the historic Fox Theater to remain silent when the candidates are actively debating.	0
10	TAPPER	The candidates need to be able to hear the questions and hear one another.	0
11	BASH	Time, now, for opening statements.	0
12	BASH	You'll each receive one minute.	0
13	BASH	Governor Steve Bullock, please begin.	0
14	BULLOCK	Thanks, Dana,	0
15	BULLOCK	I come from a state where a lot of people voted for Donald Trump.	0
16	BULLOCK	Let's not kid ourselves.	0
17	BULLOCK	He will be hard to beat.	0
18	BULLOCK	Yet watching that last debate, folks seemed more concerned about scoring points or outdoing each other with wish-list economics, than making sure Americans know we hear their voices and will help their lives.	0
19	BULLOCK	Look, I'm a pro-choice, pro-union, populist Democrat who won three elections in a red state. Not by compromising our values, but by getting stuff done. That's how we win back the places we lost: showing up, listening, focusing on the challenges of everyday Americans.	0
20	BULLOCK	That farmer getting hit right now by Trump's trade wars, that teacher working a second job, just to afford her insulin.	0
21	BULLOCK	They can't wait for a revolution.	0
22	BULLOCK	Their problems are in the here and now.	0
23	BULLOCK	I’m a progressive, emphasis on progress, and I’m running for president to get stuff done for all those Americans Washington has left behind.	0
24	BASH	Marianne Williamson?	0
25	WILLIAMSON	Thank you.	0
26	WILLIAMSON	In 1776 our founders brought forth on this planet an extraordinary new possibility.	0
27	WILLIAMSON	It was the idea that people, no matter who they were, would simply have the possibility of thriving.	0
28	WILLIAMSON	We have not ever totally actualized this ideal.	0
29	WILLIAMSON	But at the times when we have done best, we have tried.	0
30	WILLIAMSON	And when forces have opposed them, generations of Americans have risen up and pushed back against those forces.	0
31	WILLIAMSON	We did that with abolition and with women's suffrage and with civil rights.	0
32	WILLIAMSON	And now it is time for a generation of Americans to rise up again, for an amoral economic system has turned short-term profits for huge multi-national corporations into a false god.	0
33	WILLIAMSON	And this new false god takes precedence over the safety and the health and the well-being of we the American people and the people of the world and the planet on which we live.	0
34	WILLIAMSON	Conventional politics will not solve this problem because conventional politics is part of the problem.	0
35	WILLIAMSON	We the American people must rise up and do what we do best and create a new possibility, say no to what we don't want and yes to what we know can be true.	0
36	WILLIAMSON	I'm Marianne Williamson, and that's why I'm running for president.	0
37	BASH	Congressman John Delaney?	0
38	DELANEY	Folks, we have a choice.	0
39	DELANEY	We can go down the road that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren want to take us, which is with bad policies like Medicare for all, free everything and impossible promises that will turn off independent voters and get Trump re-elected.	0
40	DELANEY	That’s what happened with McGovern.	0
41	DELANEY	That’s what happened with Mondale.	0
42	DELANEY	That’s what happened with Dukakis.	0
43	DELANEY	Or we can nominate someone with new ideas to create universal health care for every American with choice, someone who wants to unify our country and grow the economy and create jobs everywhere.	0
44	DELANEY	And then we win the White House.	0
45	DELANEY	I'm the product of the American dream.	0
46	DELANEY	I believe in it.	0
47	DELANEY	I'm the grandson of immigrants, the son of a construction worker.	0
48	DELANEY	My wife April and I have four amazing daughters.	0
49	DELANEY	I was the youngest CEO in the history of the New York Stock Exchange, created thousands of jobs and then served in Congress.	0
50	DELANEY	That's the type of background -- and my platform is about real solutions, not impossible promises, that can beat Trump and govern.	0
51	DELANEY	Thank you.	0
52	BASH	Congressman Tim Ryan?	0
53	RYAN	America is great, but not everyone can access America's greatness.	0
54	RYAN	The systems that were built to lift us up are now suffocating the American people.	0
55	RYAN	The economic system that used to create $30, $40, $50 an hour jobs that you can have a good, solid middle-class living now force us to have two or three jobs just to get by.	0
56	RYAN	Most families, when they go to sit at the kitchen table to do their bills, they get a pit in the middle of their stomach.	0
57	RYAN	We deserve better.	0
58	RYAN	And the political system is broken, too, because the entire conversation is about left or right, where are you at on the political system?	0
59	RYAN	And I'm here to say this isn't about left or right.	0
60	RYAN	This is about new and better.	0
61	RYAN	And it's not about reforming old systems.	0
62	RYAN	It's about building new systems.	0
63	RYAN	And tonight, I will offer solutions that are bold, that are realistic and that are a clean break from the past.	0
64	BASH	Governor John Hickenlooper?	0
65	HICKENLOOPER	Last year Democrats flipped 40 Republican seats in the House, and not one of those 40 Democrats supported the policies of our front-runners at center stage.	0
66	HICKENLOOPER	Now, I share their progressive values, but I'm a little more pragmatic.	0
67	HICKENLOOPER	I was out of work for two whole years until I started what became the largest brew pub in America.	0
68	HICKENLOOPER	And I learned the small -- small business lessons of how to provide service and teamwork and became a top mayor, and as governor of Colorado created the number one economy in the country.	0
69	HICKENLOOPER	We also expanded health care and reproductive rights.	0
70	HICKENLOOPER	We attacked climate change head-on.	0
71	HICKENLOOPER	We beat the NRA.	0
72	HICKENLOOPER	We did not build massive government expansions.	0
73	HICKENLOOPER	Now, some will promise a bill tonight or a plan for tonight.	0
74	HICKENLOOPER	What we focused on was making sure that we got people together to get things done, to provide solutions to problems, to make sure that we -- that we worked together and created jobs.	0
75	HICKENLOOPER	That's how we're going to beat Donald Trump.	0
76	HICKENLOOPER	That's how we're going to win Michigan and the country.	0
77	BASH	Senator Amy Klobuchar?	0
78	KLOBUCHAR	Let's get real.	0
79	KLOBUCHAR	Tonight we debate, but ultimately, we have to beat Donald Trump.	0
80	KLOBUCHAR	My background, it's a little different than his.	0
81	KLOBUCHAR	I stand before you today as a granddaughter of an iron ore miner, as a daughter of a union teacher and a newspaper man, as the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from the state of Minnesota and a candidate for president of the United States.	0
82	KLOBUCHAR	That's because we come from a country of shared dreams, and I have had it with the racist attacks.	0
83	KLOBUCHAR	I have had it with a president that says one thing on TV that has your back and then you get home and you see those charges for prescription drugs and cable and college.	0
84	KLOBUCHAR	You're going to hear a lot of promises up here, but I'm going to tell you this.	0
85	KLOBUCHAR	Yes, I have bold ideas, but they are grounded in reality.	0
86	KLOBUCHAR	And, yes, I will make some simple promises.	0
87	KLOBUCHAR	I can win this.	0
88	KLOBUCHAR	I'm from the Midwest.	0
89	KLOBUCHAR	And I have won every race, every place, every time.	0
90	KLOBUCHAR	And I will govern with integrity, the integrity worthy of the extraordinary people of this nation.	0
91	BASH	Congressman Beto O'Rourke?	0
92	O'ROURKE	I'm running for president because I believe that America discovers its greatness at its moments of greatest need.	0
93	O'ROURKE	This moment will define us forever, and I believe that in this test America will be redeemed.	0
94	O'ROURKE	In the face of cruelty and fear from a lawless president, we will choose to be the nation that stands up for the human rights of everyone, for the rule of law for everyone, and a democracy that serves everyone.	0
95	O'ROURKE	Whatever our differences, we know that, before we are anything else, we are Americans first, and we will ensure that each one of us is well enough and educated enough and paid enough to realize our full potential.	0
96	O'ROURKE	We will meet these challenges here at home, and we will lead the world in those that we face abroad, successfully confronting endless war and climate change.	0
97	O'ROURKE	At this moment of truth, let us pursue our national promise and make a more perfect union of everyone, by everyone, and for everyone.	0
98	BASH	Mayor Pete Buttigieg?	0
99	BUTTIGIEG	I'm running for president because our country is running out of time.	0
100	BUTTIGIEG	It is even bigger than the emergency of the Trump presidency.	0
101	BUTTIGIEG	Ask yourself how somebody like Donald Trump ever gets within cheating distance of the Oval Office in the first place.	0
102	BUTTIGIEG	It doesn't happen unless America is already in a crisis -- an economy that's not working for everyone, endless war, climate change.	0
103	BUTTIGIEG	We have lived this in my industrial Midwestern hometown.	0
104	BUTTIGIEG	My generation has lived this as long as we have been alive.	0
105	BUTTIGIEG	And it’s only accelerating.	0
106	BUTTIGIEG	Science tells us we have 12 years before we reach the horizon of catastrophe when it comes to our climate.	0
107	BUTTIGIEG	By 2030, the average house in this country will cost half a million bucks and a women’s right to choose may not even exist.	0
108	BUTTIGIEG	We are not going to be able to meet this moment by recycling the same arguments, policies, and politicians that have dominated Washington for as long as I have been alive.	0
109	BUTTIGIEG	We've got to summon the courage to walk away from the past and do something different.	0
110	BUTTIGIEG	This is our shot.	0
111	BUTTIGIEG	That is why I'm running for president.	0
112	BASH	Senator Elizabeth Warren?	0
113	WARREN	Donald Trump disgraces the office of president every single day.	0
114	WARREN	And anyone on this stage tonight or tomorrow night would be a far better president.	0
115	WARREN	I promise, no matter who our candidate is, I will work my heart out to beat Donald Trump and to elect a Democratic Congress.	0
116	WARREN	But our problems didn't start with Donald Trump.	0
117	WARREN	Donald Trump is part of a corrupt, rigged system that has helped the wealthy and the well-connected and kicked dirt in the faces of everyone else.	0
118	WARREN	We're not going to solve the urgent problems that we face with small ideas and spinelessness.	0
119	WARREN	We're going to solve them by being the Democratic Party of big structural change.	0
120	WARREN	We need to be the party that fights for our democracy and our economy to work for everyone.	0
121	WARREN	You know, I know what's broken in this country, I know how to fix it, and I will fight to make it happen.	0
122	BASH	Senator Bernie Sanders?	0
123	SANDERS	Tonight in America, as we speak, 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured, but the health care industry made $100 billion in profits last year.	0
124	SANDERS	Tonight, as we speak, right now, 500,000 Americans are sleeping out on the street, and yet companies like Amazon that made billions in profits did not pay one nickel in federal income tax.	0
125	SANDERS	Tonight, half of the American people are living paycheck to paycheck, and yet 49 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent.	0
126	SANDERS	Tonight, the fossil fuel industry continues to receive hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks while they destroy this planet.	0
127	SANDERS	We have got to take on Trump’s racism, his sexism, xenophobia and come together in an unprecedented grassroots movement, to not only defeat Trump but to transform our economy and our government.	0
128	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator Sanders.	0
129	TAPPER	Let's start the debate with the number-one issue for Democratic voters, health care.	0
130	TAPPER	And Senator Sanders, let's start with you.	0
131	TAPPER	You support Medicare for all, which would eventually take private health insurance away from more than 150 million Americans, in exchange for government-sponsored health care for everyone.	0
132	TAPPER	Congressman Delaney just referred to it as bad policy.	0
133	TAPPER	And previously, he has called the idea "political suicide that will just get President Trump re-elected."	0
134	TAPPER	What do you say to Congressman Delaney?	0
135	SANDERS	You're wrong.	0
136	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
137	SANDERS	Right now, we have a dysfunctional health care system	1
138	SANDERS	87 million uninsured or underinsured, $500,000 -- 500,000 Americans every year, going bankrupt because of medical bills, 30,000 people dying while the health care industry makes tens of billions of dollars in profit.	1
139	SANDERS	Five minutes away from me and John is a country, it's called Canada.	0
140	SANDERS	They guarantee health care to every man, woman and child as a human right.	0
141	SANDERS	They spend half of what we spend.	0
142	SANDERS	And by the way, when you end up in a hospital in Canada, you come out with no bill at all.	0
143	SANDERS	Health care is a human right, not a privilege.	0
144	SANDERS	I believe that, I will fight for that.	0
145	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
146	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator Sanders.	0
147	TAPPER	Congressman Delaney?	0
148	DELANEY	Well, I'm right about this.	0
149	DELANEY	We can create a universal health care system to give everyone basic health care for free, and I have a proposal to do it.	0
150	DELANEY	But we don't have to go around and be the party of subtraction, and telling half the country, who has private health insurance, that their health insurance is illegal.	0
151	DELANEY	My dad, the union electrician, loved the health care he got from the IBEW.	0
152	DELANEY	He would never want someone to take that away.	0
153	DELANEY	Half of Medicare beneficiaries now have Medicare Advantage, which is private insurance, or supplemental plans.	0
154	DELANEY	It's also bad policy.	0
155	DELANEY	It'll underfund the industry, many hospitals will close...	0
156	TAPPER	Thank you, Congressman.	0
157	DELANEY	... and it's bad policy.	0
158	TAPPER	Senator Sanders, I want to -- I...	0
159	WARREN (?)	My name was also mentioned in this.	0
160	TAPPER	We're going to come to you in one second, but let me go to Senator Sanders right now.	0
161	TAPPER	Senator Sanders?	0
162	SANDERS	The fact of the matter is, tens of millions of people lose their health insurance every single year when they change jobs or their employer changes that insurance.	0
163	SANDERS	If you want stability in the health care system, if you want a system which gives you freedom of choice with regard to a doctor or a hospital, which is a system which will not bankrupt you, the answer is to get rid of the profiteering of the drug companies...	0
164	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
165	SANDERS	... and the insurance companies, move to Medicare for all.	0
166	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
167	TAPPER	Congressman Delaney?	0
168	DELANEY	But now he’s talking about a different issue.	0
169	DELANEY	What I’m talking about is really simple.	0
170	DELANEY	We should deal with the tragedy of the uninsured and give everyone health care as a right.	0
171	DELANEY	But why do we got to be the party of taking something away from people?	0
172	WARREN	No.	0
173	WARREN	No one is the party...	0
174	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
175	TAPPER	Hold on one second, Senator.	0
176	DELANEY	That's what they're running on.	0
177	DELANEY	They're running on...	0
178	WARREN	No.	0
179	DELANEY	... telling half the country that your health insurance is illegal.	0
180	DELANEY	It says it right in the bill.	0
181	TAPPER	All right, thank you.	0
182	DELANEY	We don't have to do that.	0
183	DELANEY	We can give everyone health care...	0
184	TAPPER (?)	OK.	0
185	DELANEY	... and allow people to have choice.	0
186	DELANEY	That's the American way.	0
187	TAPPER	Thank you, Congressman.	0
188	TAPPER	Senator Warren?	0
189	WARREN	So, look.	0
190	WARREN	Let's -- let's be clear about this.	0
191	WARREN	We are the Democrats.	0
192	WARREN	We are not about trying to take away health care from anyone.	0
193	WARREN	That's what the Republicans are trying to do.	0
194	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
195	WARREN	And we should stop using Republican talking points in order to talk with each other about how to best provide that health care.	0
196	WARREN	Now, I want to have a chance to tell the story about my friend Ady Barkan.	0
197	WARREN	Ady is 35 years old.	0
198	WARREN	He has a wife, Rachael, he has a cute little boy named Carl.	0
199	WARREN	He also has ALS and it's killing him.	0
200	WARREN	Ady has health insurance, good health insurance...	0
201	TAPPER	Senator?	0
202	WARREN	... and it's not nearly enough.	0
203	TAPPER	Senator?	0
204	TAPPER	I want to -- I'm coming right...	0
205	WARREN	No, this is important.	0
206	TAPPER	...	0
207	TAPPER	I'm staying with you, I'm staying with you.	0
208	TAPPER	But you exceeded your time.	0
209	TAPPER	So let me just stay with you on Medicare for all.	0
210	WARREN	All right.	0
211	TAPPER	At the last debate, you said you’re, quote, “with Bernie on Medicare for all.” Now, Senator Sanders has said that people in the middle class will pay more in taxes to help pay for Medicare for all, though that will be offset by the elimination of insurance premiums and other costs.	0
212	TAPPER	Are you also, quote, “with Bernie” on Medicare for all when it comes to raising taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for it?	0
213	WARREN	So giant corporations and billionaires are going to pay more.	0
214	WARREN	Middle-class families are going to pay less out of pocket for their health care.	0
215	WARREN	And I'd like to finish talking about Ady, the guy who has ALS...	0
216	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
217	WARREN	This isn’t funny.	0
218	WARREN	This is somebody who has health insurance and is dying.	0
219	WARREN	And every month, he has about $9,000 in medical bills that his insurance company won’t cover.	0
220	WARREN	His wife, Rachael, is on the phone for hours and hours and hours, begging the insurance company, “Please cover what the doctors say he needs.”	0
221	WARREN	He talks about what it's like to go online with thousands of other people to beg friends, family, and strangers for money so he can cover his medical expenses.	0
222	WARREN	The basic profit model of an insurance company is taking as much money as you can in premiums and pay out as little as possible in health care coverage.	0
223	WARREN	That is not working for Americans...	0
224	TAPPER	Thank you.	0
225	WARREN	... across this country...	0
226	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
227	WARREN	Medicare for All will fix that, and that's why I'll fight for it.	0
228	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
229	TAPPER	Just a point of clarification...	0
230	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
231	TAPPER	... in 15 extra seconds, would you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All, offset, obviously, by the elimination of insurance premiums, yes or no?	0
232	WARREN	Costs will go up for billionaires and go up for corporations.	0
233	WARREN	For middle-class families, costs -- total costs -- will go down.	0
234	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
235	TAPPER	Governor Bullock, I want to bring you in.	0
236	TAPPER	You do not support Medicare for All.	0
237	TAPPER	How do you respond to Senator Warren?	0
238	BULLOCK	No, health care is so personal to all of us.	0
239	BULLOCK	Never forget when my 12-year-old son had a heart attack within 24 hours of his life.	0
240	BULLOCK	Had to be life-flighted to Salt Lake City.	0
241	BULLOCK	But because we had good insurance, he's here with me tonight.	0
242	BULLOCK	At the end of the day, I'm not going to support any plan that rips away quality health care from individuals.	0
243	BULLOCK	This is an example of wish list economics.	0
244	BULLOCK	It used to be just Republicans who wanted to repeal and replace.	0
245	BULLOCK	Now many Democrats do, as well.	0
246	BULLOCK	We can get there with a public option, negotiating drug prices, ending...	0
247	TAPPER	Thank you, Governor Bullock.	0
248	TAPPER	I want to bring in Mayor Buttigieg.	0
249	TAPPER	On the topic of whether or not the middle class should pay higher taxes in exchange for guaranteed health care and the elimination of insurance premiums, how do you respond, Mayor?	0
250	BUTTIGIEG	So we don't have to stand up here speculating about whether the public option will be better or a Medicare for All environment will be better than the corporate options.	0
251	BUTTIGIEG	We can put it to the test.	0
252	BUTTIGIEG	That's the concept of my Medicare for All Who Want It proposal.	0
253	BUTTIGIEG	That way, if people like me are right that the public alternative is going to be not only more comprehensive, but more affordable than any of the corporate options around there, we'll see Americans walk away from the corporate options into that Medicare option, and it will become Medicare for All without us having to kick anybody off their insurance.	0
254	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
255	TAPPER	Just 15 seconds on the clarification.	0
256	TAPPER	You are willing to raise taxes on middle-class Americans in order to have universal coverage with the disappearance of insurance premiums, yes or no?	0
257	BUTTIGIEG	I think you can buy into it.	0
258	BUTTIGIEG	That's the idea of Medicare for All Who Want It.	0
259	BUTTIGIEG	Look, this is a distinction without a difference, whether you're paying the same money in the form of taxes or premiums.	0
260	BUTTIGIEG	Look, in this country, if you have health coverage -- if you don't have health coverage, you're paying too much for care, and if you do have health coverage, you're paying too much for care.	0
261	TAPPER	Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.	0
262	TAPPER	I want to bring in Congressman O'Rourke on the topic of whether the middle class should pay higher taxes in exchange for universal coverage and the elimination of insurance premiums.	0
263	TAPPER	What's your response?	0
264	O'ROURKE	The answer is no.	0
265	O'ROURKE	The middle class will not pay more in taxes in order to ensure that every American is guaranteed world-class health care.	0
266	O'ROURKE	I think we're being offered a false choice, some who want to improve the Affordable Care Act at the margins, others who want a Medicare for All program that will force people off of private insurance, I have a better path.	0
267	O'ROURKE	Medicare for America.	0
268	O'ROURKE	Everyone who is uninsured is enrolled in Medicare tomorrow.	0
269	O'ROURKE	Those who are insufficiently insured are enrolled...	0
270	TAPPER	Congressman...	0
271	O'ROURKE	... in Medicare...	0
272	TAPPER	Just a 15 seconds...	0
273	O'ROURKE	And those who have employer-sponsored insurance...	0
274	TAPPER	Who is offering -- who is offering a false choice here?	0
275	O'ROURKE	Jake, this is important.	0
276	TAPPER	Who's offering a false choice here?	0
277	O’ROURKE	You have some.	0
278	O’ROURKE	Governor Bullock, who’s said that we will improve the Affordable Care Act at the margins with a public option.	0
279	O’ROURKE	You have others to my right who are talking about taking away people’s choice for the private insurance they have or members of unions.	0
280	O’ROURKE	I was listening to Dee Taylor in Nevada...	0
281	TAPPER	Thank you, Congressman.	0
282	TAPPER	Governor Bullock...	0
283	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
284	TAPPER	... he just said you're offering a false choice, sir.	0
285	BULLOCK	Congressman, not at all.	0
286	BULLOCK	You know, it took us decades and false starts to get the Affordable Care Act.	0
287	BULLOCK	So let's actually build on it.	0
288	BULLOCK	A public option, allowing anyone to buy in.	0
289	BULLOCK	You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any place actually in the world.	0
290	BULLOCK	We got nothing to show for it.	0
291	BULLOCK	Negotiate prescription drug prices.	0
292	BULLOCK	End surprise medical billing.	0
293	BULLOCK	That's the way that we can get there without disrupting the lives of 160 million people that like their employer-sponsored health insurance.	0
294	TAPPER	Congressman O’Rourke, you can respond.	0
295	TAPPER	Congressman O’Rourke, you can respond.	0
296	O'ROURKE	Every estimate that I've seen of expanding ACA even through a public option still leaves millions of people uninsured and also means that people are not guaranteed the health care that they need, as the example that Senator Warren showed us.	0
297	O'ROURKE	Our plan ensures that everyone is enrolled in Medicare or can keep their employer-sponsored insurance.	0
298	O'ROURKE	When we listen to the American people -- and this is what they want us to do -- they want everyone covered, but they want to be able to maintain choice...	0
299	TAPPER	Thank you, Congressman.	0
300	O'ROURKE	... and our plan does that.	0
301	TAPPER	Thank you, Congressman.	0
302	TAPPER	I want to bring in Senator Klobuchar.	0
303	TAPPER	Senator Warren at the beginning of the night said that Democrats cannot bring -- cannot win the White House with small ideas and spinelessness.	0
304	TAPPER	In the last debate, she said the politicians who are not supporting Medicare for All simply lack the will to fight for it.	0
305	TAPPER	You do not support Medicare for All.	0
306	TAPPER	Is Senator Warren correct?	0
307	TAPPER	Do you just not lack the will to fight for it?	0
308	KLOBUCHAR	That is incorrect.	0
309	KLOBUCHAR	I just have a better way to do this.	0
310	KLOBUCHAR	And in one of my first debates, Jake, I was called a street fighter from the iron range by my opponent.	0
311	KLOBUCHAR	And when she said it, I said thank you.	0
312	KLOBUCHAR	So this is what I think we need to get done.	0
313	KLOBUCHAR	We need the public option.	0
314	KLOBUCHAR	That's what Barack Obama wanted, and it would bring health care costs down for everyone.	0
315	KLOBUCHAR	And by the way, I just don't buy this.	0
316	KLOBUCHAR	I've heard some of these candidates say that it's somehow not moral if you -- not moral to not have that public option.	0
317	KLOBUCHAR	Well, Senator Sanders was actually on a public option bill last year, and that was, Bernie, the Medicaid public option bill that Senator Schatz introduced.	0
318	KLOBUCHAR	Clearly, this is the easiest way to move forward quickly, and I want to get things done.	0
319	KLOBUCHAR	People can't wait.	0
320	KLOBUCHAR	I've got my friend, Nicole, out there whose son was actually died trying to ration his insulin as a restaurant manager.	0
321	KLOBUCHAR	And he died because he didn't have enough money to pay for it.	0
322	TAPPER	Senator...	0
323	SANDERS	Jake.	0
324	KLOBUCHAR	And Bernie and I have worked on pharmaceutical issues together.	0
325	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
326	KLOBUCHAR	We can get less expensive drugs.	0
327	TAPPER	Senator Sanders -- I'm going to go to Senator Sanders, then Senator Warren, because you both were mentioned.	0
328	TAPPER	Senator Sanders?	0
329	SANDERS	As the author -- as the author of the Medicare bill, let me clear up one thing.	0
330	SANDERS	As people talk about having insurance, there are millions of people who have insurance, they can't go to the doctor, and when they come out of the hospital, they go bankrupt.	0
331	SANDERS	All right?	0
332	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
333	SANDERS	What I am talking about and others up here are talking about is no deductibles and no co-payments.	0
334	SANDERS	And, Jake, your question is a Republican talking point.	0
335	SANDERS	At the end of the day...	0
336	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
337	SANDERS	And by the way -- and by the way -- by the way -- the health care industry will be advertising tonight on this program.	0
338	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
339	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
340	TAPPER	Senator Warren, it's your turn.	0
341	SANDERS	Oh, can I complete that, please?	0
342	TAPPER	Your time is up.	0
343	TAPPER	Thirty seconds.	0
344	SANDERS	They will be advertising tonight with that talking point.	0
345	TAPPER	Senator Warren?	0
346	WARREN	So we have to think of this in terms of the big frame.	0
347	WARREN	What's the problem in Washington?	0
348	WARREN	It works great for the wealthy.	0
349	WARREN	It works great for those who can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers.	0
350	WARREN	And it keeps working great for the insurance companies and the drug companies.	0
351	WARREN	What it's going to take is real courage to fight back against them.	0
352	WARREN	These insurance companies do not have a God-given right to make $23 billion in profits and suck it out of our health care system.	0
353	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
354	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
355	WARREN	They do not have a God-given right...	0
356	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
357	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
358	KLOBUCHAR	On page eight of the bill it says...	0
359	WARREN	... to put...	0
360	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
361	TAPPER	I want to let Congressman Delaney in.	0
362	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
363	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
364	TAPPER	If we could all just stick to the rules of the time, that would be great.	0
365	TAPPER	Congressman Delaney?	0
366	DELANEY	So I was -- I'm the only one on this stage who actually has experience in the health care business.	0
367	DELANEY	And with all due respect, I don't think my colleagues understand the business.	0
368	DELANEY	We have the public option, which is great.	0
369	SANDERS	It's not a business!	0
370	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
371	DELANEY	The public option is great, but it doesn't go far enough.	0
372	DELANEY	It doesn't go far enough.	0
373	DELANEY	I'm proposing universal health care, where everyone gets health care as a basic human right for free, but they have choices.	0
374	DELANEY	My plan, BetterCare, is fully paid for without raising middle class tax options.	0
375	DELANEY	So when we think about this debate...	0
376	TAPPER	Thank you, Congressman.	0
377	DELANEY	There's Medicare for All, which is extreme...	0
378	TAPPER	Thank you, Congressman.	0
379	DELANEY	I was interrupted.	0
380	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
381	TAPPER	I want to bring in -- I want to bring in Governor Hickenlooper.	0
382	TAPPER	Governor Hickenlooper, I'd like to hear what you say about Senator Warren's suggestion that those people on the stage who are not in favor of Medicare for All lack the political will to fight for it.	0
383	HICKENLOOPER	Well, obviously, I disagree with that as much as I respect both of the senators to my right.	0
384	HICKENLOOPER	You know, it comes down to that question of Americans being used to being able to make choices, to have the right to make a decision.	0
385	HICKENLOOPER	And I think proposing a public option that allows some form of Medicare that maybe is a combination of Medicare Advantage and Medicare, but people choose it, and if enough people choose it, it expands, the quality improves, the cost comes down, more people choose it, eventually, in 15 years, you could get there, but it would be an evolution, not a revolution.	0
386	TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.	0
387	TAPPER	Senator Warren?	0
388	WARREN	You know...	0
389	(UNKNOWN)	Jake?	0
390	WARREN	... we have tried this experiment with the insurance companies.	0
391	WARREN	And what they've done is they've sucked billions of dollars out of our health care system.	0
392	WARREN	And they force people to have to fight to try to get the health care coverage that their doctors and nurses say that they need.	0
393	WARREN	Why does everybody -- why does every doctor, why does every hospital have to fill out so many complicated forms?	0
394	WARREN	It's because it gives insurance companies a chance to say no and to push that cost back on the patients.	0
395	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
396	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator Warren.	0
397	WARREN	That's what we have to fight.	0
398	TAPPER	I want to bring in Marianne Williamson.	0
399	TAPPER	Ms. Williamson, how do you respond to the criticism from Senator Warren that you’re not willing to fight for Medicare for All?	0
400	WILLIAMSON	I don't know if Senator Warren said that about me specifically.	0
401	WILLIAMSON	I admire very much what Senator Warren has said and what Bernie has said.	0
402	WILLIAMSON	But I have to say, I have -- I'm normally way over there with Bernie and Elizabeth on this one.	0
403	WILLIAMSON	I hear the others.	0
404	WILLIAMSON	And I have some concern about that, as well.	0
405	WILLIAMSON	And I do have concern about what the Republicans would say.	0
406	WILLIAMSON	And that's not just a Republican talking point.	0
407	WILLIAMSON	I do have concern that it will be difficult.	0
408	WILLIAMSON	I have concern that it will make it harder to win, and I have a concern that it'll make it harder to govern.	0
409	WILLIAMSON	Because if that's our big fight, then --	0
410	TAPPER	Thank you Ms. Williamson.	0
411	WILLIAMSON	The Republicans will so shut us down on everything else.	0
412	TAPPER	I want to bring in Mayor Buttigieg -- Mayor Buttigieg, your response?	0
413	BUTTIGIEG	It is time to stop worrying about what the Republicans will say.	0
414	BUTTIGIEG	Look, if --	0
415	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
416	BUTTIGIEG	If it's true that if we embrace a far-left agenda they're going to say we're a bunch of crazy socialists.	0
417	BUTTIGIEG	If we embrace a conservative agenda, you know what they're going to do?	0
418	BUTTIGIEG	They're going to say we're a bunch of crazy socialists.	0
419	BUTTIGIEG	So let's just stand up for the right policy, go out there and defend it.	0
420	BUTTIGIEG	That's the policy I'm putting forward, not because I think it's the right triangulation between Republicans here and Democrats there -- because I think it's the right answer for people like my mother-in-law who is here -- whose life was saved by the ACA, but who is still far too vulnerable to the fact that the insurance industry does not care about her --	0
421	TAPPER	Thank you Mayor Buttigieg, Senator Sanders your response?	0
422	SANDERS	Let's be clear what this debate is about.	0
423	SANDERS	Nobody can defend the dysfunctionality of the current system.	0
424	SANDERS	What we are taking on is the fact that over the last 20 years the drug companies and the insurance companies have spent $4.5 billion of your health insurance money on lobbying and campaign contributions.	0
425	SANDERS	That is why when I went to Canada the other day, people paid one-tenth the price in Canada for insulin that they're paying in the United States --	0
426	TAPPER	Thank you Senator.	0
427	TAPPER	I want to bring in Congressman Tim Ryan, Congressman Ryan your response?	0
428	RYAN	So here we are in Detroit, home of the United Auto workers.	0
429	RYAN	We have all our union friends here tonight.	0
430	RYAN	This plan that's being offered by Senator Warren and Senator Sanders will tell those Union members who gave away wages in order to get good healthcare that they're going to lose their healthcare because Washington's going to come in and tell them they got a better plan.	0
431	RYAN	This is the left and right thing -- new and better is this, move Medicare down to 50.	0
432	RYAN	Allow people to buy-in, Kaiser Permanente said that if they -- those 60 million people do that, they will see --	0
433	TAPPER	Thank you Congressman.	0
434	RYAN	A 40 percent reduction --	0
435	TAPPER	Thank you Congressman.	0
436	RYAN	In their healthcare cost, let businesses buy-in, Jake --	0
437	TAPPER	Thank you Congressman.	0
438	TAPPER	So Senator, let's talk about that.	0
439	TAPPER	If Medicare for all is enacted, there are more than 600,000 union members here in Michigan who would be forced to give up their private healthcare plans.	0
440	TAPPER	Now, I understand that it would provide universal coverage -- but, can you guarantee those union members that the benefits under Medicare for all will be as good as the benefits that they're representatives -- their union reps fought hard to negotiate?	0
441	SANDERS	Well two things, they will be better because Medicare for all is comprehensive -- it covers all healthcare needs.	0
442	SANDERS	For senior citizens it will finally include dental care, hearing aids and eyeglasses.	0
443	RYAN	But you don't know that -- you don't know that, Bernie.	0
444	SANDERS	Second of all --	0
445	TAPPER	I'll come to you in a second, Congressman.	0
446	SANDERS	I do know it, I wrote the damn bill.	0
447	SANDERS	And second of all, second of all -- many of our union brothers and sisters, nobody more pro-union than me up here, are now paying high deductibles and copayments when we do Medicare for all, instead of having the company putting money in to healthcare, they can get decent wage increases, which they're not getting today.	0
448	TAPPER	I want to bring in Congressman Ryan to respond to what Senator Sanders just said.	0
449	RYAN	I mean, Senator Sanders does not know all of the union contracts in the United States.	0
450	RYAN	I'm trying to explain that these union members are losing their jobs, their wages have been stagnant, the world is crumbling around them -- the only thing they have is possibly really good healthcare.	0
451	RYAN	And the Democratic message is going to be, we're going to go in and the only thing you have left we're going to take it and we're going to do better.	0
452	RYAN	I do not think that's a recipe for success for us, it's bad policy and it's certainly bad politics.	0
453	TAPPER	Congressman Delaney.	0
454	DELANEY	So the bill that Senator Sanders drafted, by definition will lower quality in healthcare, because it says specifically that the rates will be the same as current Medicare rates.	0
455	DELANEY	And the data is clear, Medicare does not cover the cost of healthcare, it covers 80 percent of the costs of healthcare in this country.	0
456	DELANEY	And private insurance covers 120 percent, so if you start underpaying all the healthcare providers, you're going to create a two tier market where wealthy people buy their healthcare with cash, and the people who are forced -- like my dad, the union electrician --	0
457	TAPPER	Thank you Congressman.	0
458	DELANEY	Will have that healthcare plan taken away from him --	0
459	TAPPER	Thank you Congressman --	0
460	DELANEY	They will be forced into an underfunded system.	0
461	TAPPER	I want to give Senator Sanders -- I want to give Senator Sanders a chance to respond.	0
462	SANDERS	On the Medicare for all, the hospitals will save substantial sums of money because they're not going to be spending a fortune doing billing and the other bureaucratic things that they have to do today.	0
463	SANDERS	Second of all --	0
464	DELANEY	I've done the math, it doesn't add up.	0
465	SANDERS	Maybe you did that and made money off of healthcare, but our job is to run a nonprofit healthcare system.	0
466	SANDERS	Furthermore -- furthermore, when we say $500 billion a year by ending all of the incredible complexities that are driving every American crazy trying to deal with the health insurance companies --	0
467	TAPPER	Thank you Senator.	0
468	SANDERS	Hospitals will be better off than they are today.	0
469	TAPPER	Congressman Delaney, I want to let you have a chance to respond.	0
470	DELANEY	Listen, his math is wrong.	0
471	DELANEY	That's all I'm saying -- that his math is wrong, it's been well-documented that if all the bills were paid at Medicare rate, which is specifically -- I think it's in section 1,200 of their bill, then many hospitals in this country would close.	1
472	DELANEY	I've been going around rural America, and I ask rural hospital administrators one question, "If all your bills were paid at the Medicare rate last year, what would happen?"	1
473	DELANEY	And they all look at me and say, "We would close."	1
474	DELANEY	But the question is, why do we have to be so extreme?	0
475	DELANEY	Why can't we just give everyone health care as a right, and allow them to have choice?	0
476	BASH	Thank you, Congressman.	0
477	DELANEY	I'm starting to think this is not about health care...	0
478	BASH	Thank you, Congressman...	0
479	DELANEY	This is an anti-private-sector...	0
480	BASH	Thank you Congressman.	0
481	BASH	We're going to move on.	0
482	DELANEY	... strategy.	0
483	BASH	We're going to move on to the issue of immigration now.	0
484	BASH	There is...	0
485	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
486	BASH	... widespread agreement on this stage on the need for immigration reform, a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, including dreamers.	0
487	BASH	But there are some areas of disagreement.	0
488	BASH	Mayor Buttigieg, you're in favor of getting rid of the law that makes it a crime to come across the U.S. border illegally.	0
489	BASH	Why won't that just encourage more illegal immigration?	0
490	BUTTIGIEG	When I am president, illegally crossing the border will still be illegal.	0
491	BUTTIGIEG	We can argue over the finer points of which parts of this ought to be handled by civil law and which parts ought to be handled by criminal law.	0
492	BUTTIGIEG	But we've got a crisis on our hands.	0
493	BUTTIGIEG	And it's not just a crisis of immigration; it's a crisis of cruelty and incompetence that has created a humanitarian disaster on our southern border.	0
494	BUTTIGIEG	It is a stain on the United States of America.	0
495	BUTTIGIEG	Americans want comprehensive immigration reform.	0
496	BUTTIGIEG	And frankly, we've been talking about the same framework for my entire adult lifetime, protections for DREAMers; making sure that -- that we have a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented; cleaning up lawful immigration.	0
497	BUTTIGIEG	We know what to do.	0
498	BUTTIGIEG	We know that border security can be part of that package and we can still be a nation of laws.	0
499	BUTTIGIEG	The problem is we haven't had the will to get it done in Washington.	0
500	BUTTIGIEG	And now we have a president who could fix it in a month, because there is that bipartisan agreement, but he needs it to be a crisis rather than an achievement.	0
501	BUTTIGIEG	That will end on my watch.	0
502	BASH	But just a point of clarification, you did raise your hand in the last debate.	0
503	BASH	You do want to decriminalize crossing the border illegally?	0
504	BUTTIGIEG	So in my view, if fraud is involved, then that's suitable for the criminal statute.	0
505	BUTTIGIEG	If not, then it should be handled under civil law.	0
506	BUTTIGIEG	But these show of hands are exactly what is wrong with the way that this race is being covered.	0
507	BASH	Well, we're not -- we're not doing that here.	0
508	BUTTIGIEG	And we appreciate that.	0
509	BASH	Congressman -- thank you.	0
510	BASH	Congressman...	0
511	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
512	BASH	... O'Rourke, you live near the U.S.-Mexico border in El Paso.	0
513	BASH	You disagree with Mayor Buttigieg on decriminalizing the border crossings.	0
514	BASH	Please respond.	0
515	O'ROURKE	I do, because, in my administration, after we have waived citizenship fees for green card holders, more than 9 million of our fellow Americans; freed DREAMers from any fear of deportation; and stopped criminally prosecuting families and children for seeking asylum and refuge; end for-profit detention in this country; and then assist...	0
516	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
517	O'ROURKE	... those countries in Central America so that no family ever has to make that 2,000-mile journey, than I expect that people who come here follow our laws, and we reserve the right to criminally prosecute them if they do not.	0
518	BASH	Thank you, Congressman.	0
519	BASH	Senator Warren, you say the provision making illegal border crossings a crime is totally unnecessary.	0
520	BASH	Please respond.	0
521	WARREN	So the problem is that, right now, the criminalization statute is what gives Donald Trump the ability to take children away from their parents.	1
522	WARREN	It's what gives him the ability to lock up people at our borders.	0
523	WARREN	We need to continue to have border security, and we can do that, but what we can't do is not live our values.	0
524	WARREN	I've been down to the border.	0
525	WARREN	I have seen the mothers.	0
526	WARREN	I have seen the cages of babies.	0
527	WARREN	We must be a country that every day lives our values.	0
528	WARREN	And that means we cannot...	0
529	BASH	Thank you, Senator Warren.	0
530	WARREN	... make it a crime...	0
531	BASH	Just to clarify...	0
532	WARREN	... when someone...	0
533	BASH	Thank you, Senator.	0
534	BASH	Just to clarify, would you decriminalize...	0
535	WARREN	Yes.	0
536	BASH	... illegal border crossings?	0
537	WARREN	The point is not about criminalization.	0
538	WARREN	That has given Donald Trump the tool to break families apart.	0
539	BASH	Thank you, Senator.	0
540	WARREN	We need...	0
541	BASH	Governor Hickenlooper, your response?	0
542	HICKENLOOPER	I agree that we need secure borders.	0
543	HICKENLOOPER	There's no question about that.	0
544	HICKENLOOPER	And the frustration with what's going on in Washington is they're kicking the ball back and forth.	0
545	HICKENLOOPER	Secure the borders, make sure whatever law we have doesn't allow children to be snatched from their parents and put in cages.	0
546	HICKENLOOPER	How hard can that be?	0
547	HICKENLOOPER	We've got -- I don't know -- on the two debate nights, we've got 170 years of Washington experience.	0
548	HICKENLOOPER	Somehow it seems like that should be fairly fixable.	0
549	WARREN	Well, and one way to fix it is to decriminalize.	0
550	WARREN	That's the whole point.	0
551	WARREN	What we're...	0
552	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
553	WARREN	... looking for here is a way to take away the tool that Donald Trump has used...	0
554	BASH	Thank you, Senator Warren.	0
555	WARREN	... to break up families.	0
556	BASH	Thank you, Senator Warren.	0
557	BASH	Senator Klobuchar, your response?	0
558	KLOBUCHAR	I would say there is the will to change this in Congress.	0
559	KLOBUCHAR	What's missing is the right person in the White House.	0
560	KLOBUCHAR	I believe that immigrants don't diminish America; they are America.	0
561	KLOBUCHAR	And if you want to do something...	0
562	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
563	KLOBUCHAR	... about border security, you first of all change the rules so people can seek asylum in those Northern Triangle countries.	0
564	KLOBUCHAR	Then, you pass the bill.	0
565	KLOBUCHAR	And what the bill will do is, it will greatly reduce the deficit and give us some money for border security and for border processing the cases.	0
566	KLOBUCHAR	And most of all, it will allow for a path to citizenship.	0
567	KLOBUCHAR	Because this is not just about the border...	0
568	BASH	Thank you.	0
569	KLOBUCHAR	... Donald Trump wants to use these people as political pawns, when we have people...	0
570	BASH	Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.	0
571	KLOBUCHAR	... all over our country that simply want to work...	0
572	BASH	Thank you.	0
573	KLOBUCHAR	... and obey the law.	0
574	BASH	Senator Sanders, you want to provide undocumented immigrants free health care and free college.	0
575	BASH	Why won't this drive even more people to come to the U.S. illegally?	0
576	SANDERS	Because we’ll have strong border protections.	0
577	SANDERS	But the main point I want to make is that what Trump is doing through his racism and his xenophobia, is demonizing a group of people.	0
578	SANDERS	And as president, I will end that demonization.	0
579	SANDERS	If a mother and a child walk thousands of miles on a dangerous path, in my view, they are not criminals.	0
580	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
581	SANDERS	They are people fleeing violence.	0
582	SANDERS	And I think the main thing that we’ve got to do -- among many others, and Beto made this point -- we’ve got to ask ourselves, “Why are people walking 2,000 miles to a strange country where they don’t know the language?”	0
583	SANDERS	So what we will do, the first week we are in the White House, is bring the entire hemisphere together to talk about how we rebuild Honduras...	0
584	BASH	Thank...	0
585	SANDERS	... Guatemala and El Salvador so people do not have to flee their own countries.	0
586	BASH	Thank you, Senator.	0
587	BASH	Governor Bullock, about two-thirds of Democratic voters and many of your rivals here for the nomination, support giving health insurance to undocumented immigrants.	0
588	BASH	You haven't gone that far.	0
589	BASH	Why not?	0
590	BULLOCK	Look, I think this is the part of the discussion that shows how often these debates are detached from people's lives.	0
591	BULLOCK	We've got 100,000 people showing up at the border right now.	0
592	BULLOCK	If we decriminalize entry, if we give health care to everyone, we'll have multiples of that.	0
593	BULLOCK	Don't take my word, that was President Obama's Homeland Security secretary that said that.	0
594	BULLOCK	The biggest problem right now that we have with immigration, it's Donald Trump.	0
595	BULLOCK	He's using immigration to not only rip apart families, but rip apart this country.	0
596	BULLOCK	We can actually get to the point where we have safe borders, where we have a path to citizenship, where we have opportunities for Dreamers.	0
597	BULLOCK	And you don't have to decriminalize everything.	0
598	BULLOCK	What you have to do is have a president in there with the judgment and the decency to treat someone that comes to the border like one of our own.	0
599	WARREN	You know, I just wanted to...	0
600	BASH	Senator...	0
601	WARREN	... add on this...	0
602	BASH	... he just said your plan in unrealistic.	0
603	BASH	How do you respond?	0
604	WARREN	You know, I think that what we have to do, is we have to be an America that is clear about what we want to do with immigration.	0
605	WARREN	We need to expand legal immigration.	0
606	WARREN	We need to create a path for citizenship, not just for Dreamers but for grandmas and for people who have been working here in the farms and for students who have overstayed their visas...	0
607	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
608	WARREN	... we need to fix the crisis at the border.	0
609	WARREN	And a big part of how we do that, is we do not play into Donald Trump's hands.	0
610	BULLOCK	But...	0
611	WARREN	He wants to stir up the crisis at the border because that's his overall message.	0
612	WARREN	It's -- if there's anything wrong in your life, blame them.	0
613	BASH	Thank you, Senator Warren.	0
614	BASH	Governor Bullock, your response?	0
615	BULLOCK	But you are playing into Donald Trump's hands.	0
616	BULLOCK	The challenge isn't that it's a criminal offense to cross the border.	0
617	BULLOCK	The challenge is that Donald Trump is president, and using this to rip families apart.	0
618	BULLOCK	A sane immigration system needs a sane leader.	0
619	BULLOCK	And we can do that without decriminalizing and providing health care for everyone.	0
620	BULLOCK	And it's not me saying that, that's Obama's Homeland Security secretary...	0
621	WARREN	No.	0
622	BULLOCK	... that said you'll cause further problems at the border, not making it better.	0
623	WARREN	What -- what you're saying is ignore the law.	0
624	WARREN	Laws matter.	0
625	WARREN	And it matters if we say our law is that we will lock people up who come here, seeking refuge, who come here, seeking asylum, that is not a crime.	0
626	WARREN	And as Americans, what we need to do is have a sane system that keeps us safe at the border, but does not criminalize the activity...	0
627	BASH	Thank you, Senator Warren.	0
628	WARREN	... of a mother fleeing here for safety.	0
629	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
630	BULLOCK	Dana, I must correct the record	0
631	BASH	Congressman Ryan, are Senator Sanders’ proposals going to incentivize undocumented immigrants to come into this country illegally?	0
632	RYAN	Yes.	0
633	RYAN	And right now, if you want to come into the country, you should at least ring the doorbell.	0
634	RYAN	We have asylum laws.	0
635	RYAN	I saw the kids up in Grand Rapids, not far from here.	0
636	RYAN	It is shameful what's happening.	0
637	RYAN	But Donald Trump is doing it.	0
638	RYAN	And even if you decriminalize, which we should not do, you still have statutory authority.	0
639	RYAN	The president could still use his authority to separate families.	0
640	RYAN	So we've got to get rid of Donald Trump.	0
641	RYAN	But you don't decriminalize people just walking into the United States.	0
642	RYAN	If they're seeking asylum, of course, we want to welcome them.	0
643	RYAN	We're a strong enough country to be able to welcome them.	0
644	RYAN	And as far as the healthcare goes, undocumented people can buy healthcare too.	0
645	RYAN	I mean everyone else in America is paying for their healthcare.	0
646	RYAN	I think - I don't think it's a stretch for us to ask undocumented people in the country to also pay for healthcare.	0
647	BASH	Senator Sanders, your response?	0
648	SANDERS	Well, I have two things.	0
649	SANDERS	A sane immigration policy moves the comprehensive immigration reform.	0
650	SANDERS	It moves to a humane border policy, and which, by the way, we have enough administrative judges, so that we don’t have incredible backlogs that we have right now.	0
651	SANDERS	But to your answer your question, I happen to believe that when I talk about healthcare as a human right that applies to all people in this country, and under a Medicare for All single payer system, we could afford to do that.	0
652	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
653	BASH	Senator Sanders, thank you.	0
654	BASH	And Ms. Williamson, your response?	0
655	WILLIAMSON	Everything that we're talking about here tonight is what's wrong with American politics, and the Democratic Party needs to understand that we should be the party that talks, not just about symptoms, but also about causes.	0
656	WILLIAMSON	When it - when we're talking about healthcare, we need to talk about more than just the healthcare plan.	0
657	WILLIAMSON	We need to realize, we have a sickness care rather than a healthcare system.	0
658	WILLIAMSON	We need to be the party talking about why so many of our chemical policies and our food policies and our agricultural policies and our environment policies and even our economic policies are leading to people sick to begin with.	0
659	LEMON	Thank you --	0
660	WILLIAMSON	That's what the democratic -- but I want to say more --	0
661	LEMON	Thank you, Ms. Williamson.	0
662	WILLIAMSON	#NAME?	0
663	WILLIAMSON	OK.	0
664	LEMON	Thank you, Ms. Williamson.	0
665	WILLIAMSON	I hope you’ll come back to me this time.	0
666	LEMON	Go ahead.	0
667	LEMON	Thank you, Ms. Williamson.	0
668	LEMON	Let’s turn now to the issue of gun violence.	0
669	LEMON	There were three large-scale shootings this past week in America, at a park in Brooklyn, on the streets on Philadelphia and one that left three dead and 12 injured at a food festival in Gilroy, California.	0
670	LEMON	Governor - excuse me, Mayor Buttigieg, other than offering words of comfort, what’re you specially going to do to stop this epidemic of gun violence?	0
671	BUTTIGIEG	Well, this epidemic of gun violence has hit my community too, far too many times.	0
672	BUTTIGIEG	It’s the worst part of being there, getting the phone call, consoling, grieving parents.	0
673	BUTTIGIEG	And we have a mass shooting’s worth of killings everyday in this country.	0
674	BUTTIGIEG	What we’re doing hasn’t worked because we haven’t had a system in Washington capable of delivering what the American people have told us they want.	0
675	BUTTIGIEG	Eighty, 90 percent of Republicans want universal background checks, not to mention the common sense solutions like red flag laws that disarmed domestic abusers and flag mental health risks and an end to assault weapons, things like what I carried overseas in uniform, that have no business in American neighbors in peace time, let alone anywhere near a school.	0
676	BUTTIGIEG	I was at an event a few days ago, and a 13-year-old asked me what we’re going to do about school safety, and then began shaking and then began crying.	0
677	BUTTIGIEG	And we can talk about these policies, but we already know the policies.	0
678	BUTTIGIEG	I only thing I could think of, looking into the eyes of this child, is we’re supposed to be dealing with this so you don’t have to.	0
679	BUTTIGIEG	High school is hard enough, without having to worry about whether you’re going to get shot.	0
680	LEMON	Thank you.	0
681	BUTTIGIEG	And when 90 percent of Americans want something to happen --	0
682	LEMON	Thank you, Mayor.	0
683	BUTTIGIEG	-- and Washington --	0
684	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
685	LEMON	Thank you, Mayor.	0
686	LEMON	Thank you, Mayor.	0
687	LEMON	Governor Hickenlooper, your response please?	0
688	KLOBUCHAR	I disagree - I disagree with his diagnosis of the problem.	0
689	LEMON	Please standby, Senator.	0
690	KLOBUCHAR	OK.	0
691	LEMON	Please stick to the rules.	0
692	LEMON	We'll get to you - we'll come to you in a just a minute.	0
693	LEMON	Governor Hickenlooper, please respond.	0
694	HICKENLOOPER	Well, this is the fundamental nonsense of government, another thing - another place where, despite our best efforts, we can't seem to make any progress.	0
695	HICKENLOOPER	You know, when I went to the - to the movie theater in Aurora in 2012, and saw that footage of what happened at that crime scene, I'll never forget it.	0
696	HICKENLOOPER	And we decided, you know, that we were going to go out and take on the NRA, and we passed as a purple state.	0
697	HICKENLOOPER	We passed universal background checks.	0
698	HICKENLOOPER	We limited magazine capacity.	0
699	HICKENLOOPER	We did the basic work that for whatever reason doesn't seem to be able to get done in Washington.	0
700	LEMON	Thank you, Governor.	0
701	LEMON	Senator Klobuchar, please respond.	0
702	KLOBUCHAR	Yes, this isn’t just about a system, or it’s not just about words.	0
703	KLOBUCHAR	This is about the NRA.	0
704	KLOBUCHAR	I sat across from the president of the United States after Parkland, because I’ve been a leader on these issues and have the will to close to a boyfriend loophole.	0
705	KLOBUCHAR	And I watched and wrote down when, nine times, he said he wanted universal background checks.	0
706	KLOBUCHAR	The next day, he goes and he meets with the NRA, and he folds.	0
707	KLOBUCHAR	As your president, I will not fold.	0
708	KLOBUCHAR	I will make sure that we get universal background checks passed, the assault weapon ban, that we do something about magazines, and that we understand when 6 little - little 6-year-old boy died, Stephen Romero, when his dad said he’s only 6 years old, all I can -	0
709	LEMON	Thank you, Senator.	0
710	KLOBUCHAR	- say is he's 6 years old.	0
711	LEMON	Mayor Buttigieg, please respond.	0
712	KLOBUCHAR	We have to remember that.	0
713	BUTTIGIEG	This is the exact same conversation we’ve been having since - since I was in high school.	0
714	BUTTIGIEG	I was a junior when the Columbine shooting happened.	0
715	BUTTIGIEG	I was part of the first generation that saw routine school shootings.	0
716	BUTTIGIEG	We have now produced the second school shooting generation in this country.	0
717	BUTTIGIEG	We better not allow there to be a third.	0
718	BUTTIGIEG	Something is broken if it is even possible for the same debate around the same solutions that we all know are the right thing to do.	0
719	BUTTIGIEG	They won’t prevent every incident.	0
720	BUTTIGIEG	They won’t save every life.	0
721	BUTTIGIEG	But we know what to do, and it has not happened.	0
722	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
723	LEMON	Thank you, Mayor.	0
724	LEMON	Senator Klobuchar, please respond.	0
725	KLOBUCHAR	Yes.	0
726	KLOBUCHAR	What is broken is a political system that allows the NRA and other large, big money to come in and make things not happen when the majority of people are for.	0
727	KLOBUCHAR	The people are with us now.	0
728	KLOBUCHAR	After Parkland, those students just didn’t march.	0
729	KLOBUCHAR	They talked to their dads and their grandpas and the hunters in their family, and they said there must be a better way.	0
730	KLOBUCHAR	Then we elected people in the House of Representatives.	0
731	KLOBUCHAR	And guess what?	0
732	KLOBUCHAR	It changed, and they passed universal background checks.	0
733	KLOBUCHAR	And now that bill is sitting on Mitch McConnell’s doorstep because of the money and the power of the NRA.	0
734	KLOBUCHAR	As president, I will take them on.	0
735	LEMON	Thank you, Senator.	0
736	KLOBUCHAR	This is not about systems and words.	0
737	LEMON	Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.	0
738	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
739	LEMON	Governor Bullock, how can Democrats trust you to be the leader on this fight for gun safety when you only changed your position to call for an assault weapons ban last summer?	0
740	BULLOCK	You know, like 40 percent of American households, I’m a gun-owner.	0
741	BULLOCK	I hunt.	0
742	BULLOCK	Like far too many people in America, I’ve been personally impacted by gun violence.	0
743	BULLOCK	Had an 11-year-old nephew, Jeremy, shot and killed on a playground.	0
744	BULLOCK	We need to start looking at this as a public health issue, not a political issue.	0
745	BULLOCK	I agree with Senator Klobuchar.	0
746	BULLOCK	It is the NRA.	0
747	BULLOCK	And it's not just gun violence.	0
748	BULLOCK	It's when we talked about climate, when we talk about prescription drug costs, Washington, D.C., is captured by dark money, the Koch brothers, and others.	0
749	BULLOCK	That's been the fight of my career.	0
750	BULLOCK	Kicking the Koch brothers out of Montana, taking the first case after Citizens United up to the Supreme Court, making it so that elections are about people.	0
751	BULLOCK	That's the way we're actually going to make a change on this, Don, is by changing that system.	0
752	BULLOCK	And most of the things that folks are talking about on this stage we're not going to address until we kick dark money and the post-Citizens United corporate spending out of these elections.	0
753	LEMON	Congressman O'Rourke, your response?	0
754	O'ROURKE	How else can we explain that we lose nearly 40,000 people in this country to gun violence, a number that no other country comes even close to, that we know what all the solutions are, and yet nothing has changed?	0
755	O'ROURKE	It is because, in this country, money buys influence, access, and, increasingly, outcomes.	0
756	O'ROURKE	The Centers for Disease Control prevented from actually studying the issue in the first place.	0
757	O'ROURKE	As president, we will make sure that we ban political action committee contributions to any member of Congress or any candidate for federal office.	0
758	O'ROURKE	We will listen to people, not PACs, people, not corporations, people, not special interests.	0
759	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
760	LEMON	Congressman, thank you very much.	0
761	Senator Sanders, you said this in 2013, just months after the Sandy Hook massacre, and I quote here	If you pass the strongest gun control legislation tomorrow, I don't think it will have a profound effect on the tragedies we have seen.	0
762	Senator Sanders, you said this in 2013, just months after the Sandy Hook massacre, and I quote here	Do you still agree with that statement today?	0
763	SANDERS	I think we have got to do -- I think what I meant is what President Obama said, in that nobody up here is going to tell you that we have a magical solution to the crisis.	0
764	SANDERS	Now, I come from one of the most rural states in America.	0
765	SANDERS	I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA.	0
766	SANDERS	And as president I suspect it will be an F record.	0
767	SANDERS	What I believe we have got to do is have the guts to finally take on the NRA.	0
768	SANDERS	You asked me about my record.	0
769	SANDERS	Back in 1988, coming from a state that had no gun control, I called for the ban of the sale and distribution of assault weapons.	0
770	SANDERS	I lost that election.	0
771	SANDERS	I will do everything I can not only to take on the NRA, but to expand and create universal background checks, do away with the strawman provision, do away with the gun show loophole, and do away with the loopholes that now exist for gun manufacturers who are selling large amounts of weapons into communities that are going to gangs.	0
772	LEMON	Yeah.	0
773	LEMON	Mayor Buttigieg, your response.	0
774	BUTTIGIEG	Still the conversation that we've been having for the last 20 years.	0
775	BUTTIGIEG	Of course we need to get money out of politics.	0
776	BUTTIGIEG	But when I propose the actual structural democratic reforms that might make a difference, end the Electoral College, amend the Constitution, if necessary, to clear up Citizens United, have D.C. actually be a state, and depoliticize the Supreme Court with structural reform, people look at me funny, as if this country were incapable of structural reform.	0
777	BUTTIGIEG	Does anybody really think we're going to overtake Citizens United without constitutional action?	0
778	BUTTIGIEG	This is a country that once changed its Constitution so you couldn't drink and then changed it back because we changed our minds about that.	0
779	LEMON	Thank you.	0
780	LEMON	Thank you, Mayor.	0
781	BUTTIGIEG	And you're telling me we can't reform our democracy in our time?	0
782	LEMON	Thank you, Mayor.	0
783	BUTTIGIEG	We have to or we'll be having the same argument 20 years from now.	0
784	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
785	LEMON	Please respond, Governor Bullock.	0
786	BULLOCK	You can make changes.	0
787	BULLOCK	Even in Montana, with a two-thirds Republican legislature, we passed a law that said, if you're going to spend money in our elections, I don't care if you call yourselves Americans for America for America, you're going to have to disclose every one of those dollars in the last 90 days.	0
788	BULLOCK	I'll never forget running for re-election in 2016.	0
789	BULLOCK	Even we stopped the Koch brothers from spending it that time.	0
790	BULLOCK	If we can kick the Koch brothers out of Montana, we can do it in D.C., we can do it everywhere.	0
791	BULLOCK	And we're also taking steps, additional steps that we've taken -- I passed an executive order.	0
792	BULLOCK	If you're even going to contract with the state...	0
793	LEMON	Governor Bullock, thank you very much.	0
794	WARREN	I'd like to have a chance on this.	0
795	LEMON	Ms. Williamson, how do you respond to this issue of gun safety?	0
796	WILLIAMSON	The issue of gun safety, of course, is that the NRA has us in a chokehold, but so do the pharmaceutical companies, so do the health insurance companies, so do the fossil fuel companies, and so do the defense contractors, and none of this will change until we either pass a constitutional amendment or pass legislation that establishes public funding for federal campaigns.	0
797	WILLIAMSON	But for politicians, including my fellow candidates, who themselves have taken tens of thousands -- and in some cases, hundreds of thousands -- of dollars from these same corporate donors to think that they now have the moral authority to say we're going to take them on, I don't think the Democratic Party should be surprised that so many Americans believe yada, yada, yada.	0
798	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
799	It is time for us to start over with people who have not taken donations from any of those corporations and can say with real moral authority	That is over.	0
800	It is time for us to start over with people who have not taken donations from any of those corporations and can say with real moral authority	We are going to establish public funding for federal campaigns.	0
801	It is time for us to start over with people who have not taken donations from any of those corporations and can say with real moral authority	That's what we need to stand up to.	0
802	It is time for us to start over with people who have not taken donations from any of those corporations and can say with real moral authority	We need to have a constitutional amendment.	0
803	It is time for us to start over with people who have not taken donations from any of those corporations and can say with real moral authority	We need to have -- we need to have legislation to do it.	0
804	LEMON	Thank you.	0
805	WILLIAMSON	And until we do it, it's just the same old, same old.	0
806	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
807	LEMON	Thank you.	0
808	LEMON	Thank you, Ms. Williamson.	0
809	LEMON	The debate will be right back right after this short break.	0
810	TAPPER	Presidential Debate, we are live from Detroit, Michigan.	0
811	TAPPER	In poll after poll Democratic voters say that they want a candidate who can beat President Trump, more than they want a candidate who agrees with them on major issues.	0
812	TAPPER	Governor Hickenlooper, you ran a Facebook ad that warned "socialism is not the answer."	0
813	TAPPER	The ad also said, "don't let extremes give Trump four more years," are you saying that Senator Sanders is too extreme to beat President Trump?	0
814	HICKENLOOPER	I'm saying the policies of -- this notion that you're going to take private insurance away from 180 million Americans who, many of them don't want to give -- many of them do want to get rid of it, but some don't -- many don't.	0
815	HICKENLOOPER	Or you're going to -- the Green New Deal make sure that every American's guaranteed a government job if they want, that is a disaster at the ballot box, you might as well FedEx the election to Donald Trump.	0
816	HICKENLOOPER	I think we've got to focus on where Donald Trump is failing, you know, the world malpractice, and this is interesting -- I always thought it was doctors or lawyers, it's -- you know negligent, improper, illegal professional activity for doctors, lawyers or public officials, Google it, check it out.	0
817	HICKENLOOPER	Donald Trump is malpractice personified, we've got to point that out.	0
818	HICKENLOOPER	Why is it soybean farmers in Iowa need 10 good years to get back to where they were 2 years ago?	0
819	HICKENLOOPER	Where's the small manufacturing jobs that are supposed to come back?	0
820	HICKENLOOPER	Why are we lurching from one international crisis to another?	0
821	HICKENLOOPER	All things that he promised American voters, we've got to focus on that -- and the economy, and jobs, and training, so that we can promise a future for America that everybody wants to invest it.	0
822	TAPPER	Thank you Governor.	0
823	TAPPER	Senator Sanders you are a proud Democratic-Socialist, how do you respond to Governor Hickenlooper?	0
824	SANDERS	Well the truth is that every credible poll that I have seen has me beating Donald Trump -- including the battleground states of Michigan, where I won the Democratic primary -- Wisconsin where I won the Democratic primary, and Pennsylvania.	0
825	SANDERS	And the reason we are going to defeat Trump, and beat him badly is that he is a fraud and a phony and we’re going to expose him for what he is.	0
826	SANDERS	The American people want to have a minimum wage which is a living wage, $15 an hour.	0
827	SANDERS	I’ve helped lead that effort.	0
828	SANDERS	The American people want to pay reasonable prices for prescription drugs, not the highest prices in the world --	0
829	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
830	SANDERS	I've helped lead the effort for that as well.	0
831	TAPPER	Thank you Senator.	0
832	TAPPER	Governor Hickenlooper, I want to bring you back to respond?	0
833	HICKENLOOPER	So again, I think if we're going to force Americans to make these radical changes, they're not going to go along -- throw your hands up --	0
834	SANDERS	All right --	0
835	HICKENLOOPER	Oh-ho, I can do it.	0
836	HICKENLOOPER	But you haven’t implemented the plans, us governors and mayors are the ones, we have to pick up all the pieces when suddenly the government’s supposed to take over all these responsibilities, and there’s no preparation, the details aren’t worked.	0
837	HICKENLOOPER	You can’t just spring a plan on the world and expect it to succeed --	0
838	SANDERS	John --	0
839	TAPPER	Senator Sanders?	0
840	SANDERS	John, I was a mayor and I helped transform my city -- I have some practical experience.	0
841	SANDERS	Second of all, interestingly enough today is the anniversary of Medicare -- 54 years ago under Linda Johnson of the Democratic Congress they started a new program after one year 19 million elderly people in it.	0
842	SANDERS	Please don’t tell me that in a four year period we cannot go from 65 down to 55, to 45, to 35 -- this is not radical.	0
843	SANDERS	This is what virtually every other country on Earth runs --	0
844	TAPPER	Thank you Senator.	0
845	SANDERS	We are the odd dog out.	0
846	TAPPER	I want to bring in -- I want to bring in Congressman Ryan.	0
847	TAPPER	You're from the state of Ohio, it's a state that voted twice for Obama and then went to President Trump in 2016, please respond to Senator Sanders.	0
848	RYAN	Well I would just say Hillary Clinton was winning in the polls too, to take a snapshot in the polls today and apply it 16 months from now or whenever it is, I don't think is accurate.	0
849	RYAN	Now in this discussion already tonight we've talked about taking private health insurance away from union members in the industrial Midwest, we've talked about decriminalizing the border, and we've talked about giving free healthcare to undocumented workers when so many Americans are struggling to pay for their healthcare.	0
850	RYAN	I quite frankly don't think that that is an agenda that we can move forward on and win.	0
851	RYAN	We've got to talk about the working class issues, the people that take a shower after work, who haven't had a raise in 30 years --	0
852	TAPPER	Thank you -- thank you Congressman --	0
853	RYAN	If we focus on that, we'll win the election.	0
854	TAPPER	Thank you Congressman, I want to bring Congressman O'Rourke, your response, sir?	0
855	O'ROURKE	Bernie was talking about some of the battleground states in which we compete -- there is a new battleground state, Texas and it has 38 electoral college votes.	0
856	O'ROURKE	And the way that we put it in play was by going to each one of those 254 counties.	0
857	O'ROURKE	No matter how red or rural, we did not write you off.	0
858	O'ROURKE	No matter how blue, or urban -- we did not take you for granted.	0
859	O'ROURKE	And we didn't trim our sails, either.	0
860	O'ROURKE	We had the courage of our convictions, talking about universal health care, comprehensive immigration reform, and confronting the challenge of climate before it is too late.	0
861	O'ROURKE	We brought everyone in...	0
862	TAPPER	Thank you.	0
863	O'ROURKE	... and now we have a chance to beat Donald Trump with Texas.	0
864	TAPPER	Thank you, Congressman.	0
865	TAPPER	I want to bring in Governor Bullock.	0
866	TAPPER	We're talking about whether Democrats are moving too far to the left to win the White House.	0
867	TAPPER	President Trump won your home state of Montana by 20 points.	0
868	TAPPER	How do you respond, sir?	0
869	BULLOCK	Yeah, as the only one of the field of 37 that actually won a Trump state -- 25 percent to 30 percent of my voters voted for Donald Trump -- I know that we do have to win back some of those places we lost and get those Trump voters back if we’re ever going to win.	0
870	BULLOCK	But this isn't just a choice between the left and the center.	0
871	BULLOCK	It's not a choice just between sort of these wish list economics or thinking that we have to sacrifice our values to actually win.	0
872	BULLOCK	What folks want is a fair shot.	0
873	BULLOCK	The way I won, the way we can win is to actually focus on the economy and the democracy aren't working for most people.	0
874	TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.	0
875	BULLOCK	That's how I win.	0
876	BULLOCK	That's how we can take back the office.	0
877	TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.	0
878	TAPPER	Senator Warren, you make it a point to say that you're a capitalist.	0
879	TAPPER	Is that your way of convincing voters that you might be a safer choice than Senator Sanders?	0
880	WARREN	No.	0
881	WARREN	It is my way of talking about I know how to fight and I know how to win.	0
882	WARREN	I took on giant banks, and I beat them.	0
883	WARREN	I took on Wall Street, and CEOs, and their lobbyists, and their lawyers, and I beat them.	0
884	WARREN	I took on a popular Republican incumbent senator, and I beat him.	0
885	WARREN	I remember when people said Barack Obama couldn't get elected.	0
886	WARREN	Shoot, I remember when people said Donald Trump couldn't get elected.	0
887	WARREN	But here's where we are.	0
888	WARREN	I get it.	0
889	WARREN	There is a lot at stake, and people are scared.	0
890	WARREN	But we can't choose a candidate we don't believe in just because we're too scared to do anything else.	0
891	WARREN	And we can't ask other people to vote for a candidate we don't believe in.	0
892	WARREN	Democrats win when we figure out what is right and we get out there and fight for it.	0
893	WARREN	I am not afraid.	0
894	WARREN	And for Democrats to win, you can't be afraid, either.	0
895	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
896	TAPPER	Congressman Delaney, your response?	0
897	DELANEY	So -- so I think Democrats win when we run on real solutions, not impossible promises, when we run on things that are workable, not fairy tale economics.	0
898	Look at the story of Detroit, this amazing city that we're in. This city is turning around because the government and the private sector are working well together. That has to be our model going forward. We need to encourage collaboration between the government, the private sector, and the nonprofit sector, and focus on those kitchen table, pocketbook issues that matter to hard-working Americans	building infrastructure, creating jobs, improving their pay...	0
899	TAPPER	Thank you, Congressman.	0
900	DELANEY	... creating universal health care, and lowering drug prices.	0
901	TAPPER	Thank you, Congressman.	0
902	TAPPER	Senator Warren?	0
903	DELANEY	We can do it.	0
904	WARREN	You know, I don't understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can't do and shouldn't fight for.	0
905	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
906	WARREN	I don't get it.	0
907	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
908	WARREN	Our biggest problem in Washington is corruption.	0
909	WARREN	It is giant corporations that have taken our government and that are holding it by the throat.	0
910	WARREN	And we need to have the courage to fight back against that.	0
911	WARREN	And until we're ready to do that, it's just more of the same.	0
912	WARREN	Well, I'm ready to get in this fight.	0
913	WARREN	I'm ready to win this fight.	0
914	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
915	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
916	TAPPER	Congressman Delaney?	0
917	DELANEY	When we created Social Security, we didn't say pensions were illegal, right?	0
918	DELANEY	We can have big ideas to transform the lives.	0
919	DELANEY	I mean, I started two companies and took them public before I was 40.	0
920	DELANEY	I'm as big of a dreamer and an entrepreneur as anyone.	0
921	DELANEY	But I also believe we need to have solutions that are workable.	0
922	DELANEY	Can you imagine if we tried to start Social Security now but said private pensions are illegal?	0
923	DELANEY	That's the equivalent of what Senator Sanders and Senator Warren are proposing with health care.	0
924	DELANEY	That's not a big idea.	0
925	DELANEY	That's an idea that's dead on arrival.	0
926	DELANEY	That will never happen.	0
927	DELANEY	So why don't we actually talk about things, big ideas that we can get done?	0
928	DELANEY	The stakes are too high.	0
929	TAPPER	Thank you, Congressman.	0
930	TAPPER	Senator Warren?	0
931	WARREN	So, look, he talks...	0
932	SANDERS	He just mentioned my name.	0
933	TAPPER	We'll come to you right after that.	0
934	TAPPER	Senator Warren?	0
935	WARREN	He talks about solutions that are workable.	0
936	WARREN	We have tried the solution of Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance.	0
937	WARREN	And what have the private insurance companies done?	0
938	WARREN	They've sucked billions of dollars out of our health care system.	0
939	WARREN	They've made everybody fill out dozens and dozens of forms.	0
940	WARREN	Why?	0
941	WARREN	Not because they're trying to track your health care.	0
942	WARREN	They just want one more excuse to say no.	0
943	WARREN	Insurance companies do not have a God-given right to suck money out of our health care system.	0
944	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
945	WARREN	And 2020 is our chance to stop it.	0
946	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
947	TAPPER	Senator Sanders?	0
948	SANDERS	Detroit was mentioned.	0
949	SANDERS	And I'm delighted that Detroit is rebounding.	0
950	SANDERS	But let us understand, Detroit was nearly destroyed because of awful trade policy which allowed corporations to throw workers in this community out on the streets as they moved to low-wage countries.	0
951	SANDERS	To win this election, and to defeat Donald Trump -- which, by the way, in my view, is not going to be easy -- we need to have a campaign of energy and excitement and of vision.	0
952	SANDERS	We need to bring millions of young people into the political process in a way that we have never seen by, among other things, making public colleges...	0
953	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
954	SANDERS	... and universities tuition-free and canceling student debt.	0
955	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
956	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
957	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
958	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
959	TAPPER	I want to bring in -- I want to bring in Senator Klobuchar.	0
960	TAPPER	At the beginning of the night, you said you're going to hear a lot of promises on the stage.	0
961	TAPPER	And previously you have said, when asked about your primary opponents, quote, "A lot of people are making promises, and I'm not going to make promises just to get elected."	0
962	TAPPER	Who on this stage is making promises just to get elected?	0
963	KLOBUCHAR	Everyone wants to get elected.	0
964	KLOBUCHAR	But my point is this: I think when we have a guy in the White House that has now told over 10,000 lies, that we'd better be very straightforward with the American people.	0
965	KLOBUCHAR	And, no, do I think that we are going to end up voting for a plan that kicks half of America off of their current insurance in four years?	0
966	KLOBUCHAR	No, I don't think we're going to do that.	0
967	KLOBUCHAR	I think there is a better way to get what we all want to see, which is lower costs for health care.	0
968	KLOBUCHAR	Do I think that we're going to vote to give free college to the wealthiest kids?	0
969	KLOBUCHAR	No, I don't think we're going to do that.	0
970	KLOBUCHAR	So that's what I'm talking about.	0
971	KLOBUCHAR	But what I don't like about this argument right now, what I don't like about it at all, is that we are more worried about winning an argument than winning an election.	0
972	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
973	KLOBUCHAR	And I think how we win an election is to bring everyone with us.	0
974	KLOBUCHAR	And, yes, I have won in a state every single time statewide.	0
975	KLOBUCHAR	I have won those congressional districts that Donald Trump won by over 20 points.	0
976	KLOBUCHAR	He just targeted Minnesota last week.	0
977	KLOBUCHAR	And I have done it by getting out there and talking to people, by knowing rural issues and farm issues...	0
978	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.	0
979	KLOBUCHAR	... and bringing metro people with me in the state that had the highest voter turnout in the country.	0
980	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.	0
981	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
982	KLOBUCHAR	That's what we want.	0
983	TAPPER	I want to bring in Congressman O'Rourke.	0
984	TAPPER	Congressman O'Rourke, please respond.	0
985	O'ROURKE	You know, I think a big part of leadership and showing our commitment to the American people is delivering on our commitments.	0
986	O'ROURKE	As a member of Congress, when I learned that the El Paso V.A.	0
987	O'ROURKE	had the worst wait times for mental health care in the country, meaning that care delayed functionally became care denied, and was related to the suicide epidemic, we made it our priority and we turned around the V.A.	0
988	O'ROURKE	in El Paso.	0
989	O'ROURKE	We took that lesson nationally and I worked with Republican and Democratic colleagues to expand medical health care to veterans, and we got it signed into law by the one person with whom I agree on almost nothing -- Donald Trump -- to show that, at the end of the day, we will put the American people first...	0
990	BASH	Thank you.	0
991	O'ROURKE	... before party, before any other concern.	0
992	BASH	Thank you, Congressman O'Rourke.	0
993	BASH	We've been asking voters to weigh in on what they'd most like to hear Democrats debate.	0
994	BASH	Among the topics they told us they're most interested in, the climate crisis.	0
995	BASH	Congressman Delaney, I’ll start with you.	0
996	BASH	You say the Green New Deal is about as realistic as Trump saying Mexico is going to pay for the wall.	0
997	BASH	But scientists say we need essentially to eliminate fossil fuel pollution by 2050 to avoid the most catastrophic consequences.	0
998	BASH	Why isn’t this sweeping plan to fight the climate crisis realistic?	0
999	DELANEY	Well, first of all, because it ties its progress to other things that are completely unrelated to climate, like universal health care, guaranteed government jobs, and universal basic income.	0
1000	DELANEY	So that only makes it harder to do.	0
1001	DELANEY	My plan, which gets us to net zero by 2050, which we absolutely have to do for our kids and our grandkids, will get us there.	0
1002	DELANEY	I put a price on carbon, take all the money, give it back to the American people in a dividend.	0
1003	DELANEY	That was introduced by me on a bipartisan basis.	0
1004	DELANEY	It's the only significant bipartisan climate bill in the Congress.	0
1005	DELANEY	I’m going to increase the Department of Energy research budget by fivefold, because we fundamentally have to innovate our way out of this problem.	0
1006	DELANEY	I’m going to create a market for something called direct air capture, which are machines that actually take carbon out of the atmosphere, because I don’t think we’ll get to net zero by 2050 unless we have those things.	0
1007	DELANEY	I’m going to increase investment in renewables and I’m going to create something called the Climate Corps.	0
1008	DELANEY	That is a plan that's realistic.	0
1009	DELANEY	It's a bet on the U.S. private innovation economy and creates the incentives to get us to net zero by 2050 for our kids.	0
1010	BASH	Thank you.	0
1011	BASH	Thank you, Congressman.	0
1012	BASH	Senator Warren, you’re a cosponsor of the Green New Deal.	0
1013	BASH	Your response to Congressman Delaney?	0
1014	WARREN	So, climate crisis is the existential crisis for our world.	0
1015	WARREN	It puts every living thing on this planet at risk.	0
1016	WARREN	I have a plan for a green industrial policy that takes advantage of the fact that we do what we do best, and that is innovate and create.	0
1017	WARREN	So I've proposed putting $2 trillion in so we do the research.	0
1018	WARREN	We then say anyone in the world can use it, so long as you build it right here in America.	0
1019	WARREN	That will produce about 1.2 million manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan, right here in Ohio, right here in the industrial Midwest.	0
1020	WARREN	And the second thing we will do is we will then sell those products all around the world.	0
1021	WARREN	Right now, for every $1 the United States...	0
1022	BASH	Thank you.	0
1023	WARREN	... spends trying to market around the world...	0
1024	BASH	Thank you, Senator Warren.	0
1025	WARREN	... China is spending $100.	0
1026	BASH	Thank you, Senator Warren.	0
1027	BASH	Governor Hickenlooper, you take issue with the green new deal.	0
1028	BASH	Please respond.	0
1029	HICKENLOOPER	Well, I think the guarantee for a public job for everyone who wants one is a classic part of the problem.	0
1030	HICKENLOOPER	It's a distraction.	0
1031	HICKENLOOPER	I share the urgency of everyone up here.	0
1032	HICKENLOOPER	We have to recognize -- I mean, everyone's got good ideas.	0
1033	HICKENLOOPER	What we do in this country is no better than just a best practice, right?	0
1034	HICKENLOOPER	It's what we do here is a best practice and a template, but it's got to be done all over the world.	0
1035	HICKENLOOPER	So we’ve got to be building bridges right now with people like China, who were cheating on international agreements and stealing intellectual property.	0
1036	HICKENLOOPER	We need to work on that, but not with a tariff system.	0
1037	HICKENLOOPER	We need every country working together if we’re going to really deal with climate change in a realistic way.	0
1038	BASH	Thank you.	0
1039	BASH	Senator Warren, your response?	0
1040	WARREN	Look, I put a real policy on the table to create 1.2 million new jobs in green manufacturing.	0
1041	WARREN	There's going to be a $23 trillion worldwide market for this.	0
1042	WARREN	This could revitalize huge cities across this country.	0
1043	WARREN	And no one wants to talk about it.	0
1044	WARREN	What you want to do instead is find the Republican talking point of a made-up piece of some other part and say, "Oh, we don't really have to do anything."	0
1045	WARREN	That’s the problem we’ve got in Washington right now.	0
1046	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1047	WARREN	It continues to be a Washington that works great for oil companies, just not for people worried about climate change.	0
1048	BASH	Thank you, Senator Warren.	0
1049	BASH	Congressman Ryan, we are here in Michigan, where there are about 180,000 workers in auto manufacturing.	0
1050	BASH	Your state of Ohio has around 96,000 workers in that industry.	0
1051	BASH	Senator Sanders is co-sponsoring a bill that would eliminate new gas-powered car sales by 2040.	0
1052	BASH	Given the number of auto manufacturing workers in your state, how concerned are you about Senator Sanders' plan?	0
1053	RYAN	Well, if we get our act together, we won't have to worry about it.	0
1054	RYAN	I -- my plan is to create a chief manufacturing officer so we could actually start making things in the United States again, that would pull the government, the Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, work with the private sector, work with investors, emerging tech companies, to dominate the electric vehicle market.	0
1055	RYAN	China dominates it now, 50 percent to 60 percent.	0
1056	RYAN	I want us to dominate the battery market, make those here in the United States and cut the workers in on the deal.	0
1057	RYAN	The charging stations, solar panels, same thing; China dominates 60 percent of the solar panel market.	0
1058	RYAN	So this person will work in the White House, report directly to me, and we're going to start making things again.	0
1059	RYAN	But you cannot get there on climate unless we talk about agriculture.	0
1060	RYAN	We need to convert our industrial agriculture system over to a sustainable and regenerative agriculture system...	0
1061	KLOBUCHAR (?)	I agree.	0
1062	RYAN	... that actually sequesters carbon...	0
1063	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1064	RYAN	... into the soil.	0
1065	RYAN	And you can go ask -- you can go ask Gabe Brown and Allen Williams, who actually make money off of regenerative agriculture.	0
1066	RYAN	So we can move away...	0
1067	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1068	RYAN	... from all the subsidies that we're giving the farmers.	0
1069	RYAN	They haven't made a profit in five years.	0
1070	RYAN	And we could start getting good food into our schools and into our communities.	0
1071	RYAN	And that's going to drive health care down.	0
1072	RYAN	That's another part of the health care conversation...	0
1073	BASH	Thank you.	0
1074	RYAN	... that we didn't even have.	0
1075	RYAN	How do we start talking about health...	0
1076	BASH	Thank you, Congressman Ryan.	0
1077	RYAN	... instead of just disease care?	0
1078	BASH	Thank you.	0
1079	BASH	Senator Sanders, your response?	0
1080	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1081	SANDERS	I get a little bit tired of Democrats afraid of big ideas.	0
1082	SANDERS	Republicans are not afraid of big ideas.	0
1083	SANDERS	They could give $1 trillion in tax breaks to billionaires and profitable corporations.	0
1084	SANDERS	They could bail out the crooks on Wall Street.	0
1085	SANDERS	So please don't tell me that we cannot take on the fossil fuel industry.	0
1086	SANDERS	And nothing happens unless we do that.	0
1087	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1088	SANDERS	Here is the bottom line.	0
1089	SANDERS	We've got to ask ourselves a simple question, "What do you do with an industry that knowingly, for billions of dollars in short-term profits, is destroying this planet?"	0
1090	SANDERS	I say that is criminal activity that cannot be allowed to continue.	0
1091	BASH	Thank you, Senator Sanders.	0
1092	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1093	BASH	Congressman, your response?	0
1094	RYAN	Well, I would just say -- I didn't say we couldn't get there until 2040, Bernie.	0
1095	RYAN	You don't have to yell.	0
1096	RYAN	I mean, all I'm saying is...	0
1097	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1098	RYAN	All I'm saying is we have to invent our way out of this thing.	0
1099	RYAN	And if we're waiting for 2040 for a ban to come in on gasoline vehicles, we're screwed.	0
1100	RYAN	So we better get busy now.	0
1101	RYAN	And that's why I'm saying get a chief manufacturing officer, align the environmental incentives with the financial incentives, and make sure that people can actually make money off of the new technologies that are moving forward.	0
1102	RYAN	And then here's what I'll do as president...	0
1103	BASH	Thank you, Congressman.	0
1104	RYAN	... cut the worker in on the deal.	0
1105	RYAN	Make sure these are union jobs.	0
1106	RYAN	And I will double union membership to make sure these new jobs pay what the old fossil fuel jobs pay.	0
1107	BASH	Senator Sanders, your response?	0
1108	SANDERS	On this issue, my friends, there is no choice.	0
1109	SANDERS	We have got to be super aggressive if we love our children and if we want to leave them a planet that is healthy and is habitable, so I don’t disagree with Tim.	0
1110	SANDERS	What that means is we got to, A, take on the fossil fuel industry, B, it means we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy, at a hell of a lot of good union jobs, as we do that.	0
1111	SANDERS	We got to transform our transportation ...	0
1112	BASH	Thank you, Senator ...	0
1113	SANDERS	... system, and we have to lead the world ...	0
1114	BASH	Thank you, Senator Sanders.	0
1115	SANDERS	... because this is not just an American issue.	0
1116	BASH	Governor Bullock, your response?	0
1117	BULLOCK	You know, all of us agree that we have address climate change.	0
1118	BULLOCK	No one on this stage is talking about it.	0
1119	BULLOCK	The Republicans won’t even acknowledge that climate change is real, Dana, and that’s because of the corrupting influence and money.	0
1120	BULLOCK	That has been the fight of my career.	0
1121	BULLOCK	And second of which, as we transition to this clean energy economy, you’ve got to recognize, there are folks that have spent their whole life powering our country, and far too often, Democrats sound like they’re part of the problem.	0
1122	BULLOCK	We got to make sure to aid in those transition as we get to a carbon neutral world, which I think we can do by 2020.	0
1123	BASH	Thank you, Governor.	0
1124	BASH	Just to clarify, who is part of the problem?	0
1125	BULLOCK	Who - oh, no, I - I think Democrats often, when they're saying, oh, these fossil fuel industries, these workers, those coal miner workers.	0
1126	BULLOCK	Look, the world's changing.	0
1127	BULLOCK	We got to make a change, but I think Democrats often sound like the people that, as Congressman Ryan would say, shower at the end of the day, that they're part of the problem.	0
1128	BULLOCK	And far too many communities are being left behind, as we make this transition.	0
1129	BASH	Thank you.	0
1130	BULLOCK	Look, we’re having this discussion, and we can talk about competing plans...	0
1131	BASH	Thank you, Governor.	0
1132	BASH	I want to give Senator Sanders a chance to respond.	0
1133	SANDERS	Look, Steve, there ain't nobody in the Congress who's more strongly pro-worker than I am.	0
1134	SANDERS	So when I talk about taking on the fossil fuel industry, what I am also talking about is a just transition.	0
1135	SANDERS	All right.	0
1136	SANDERS	We can create what the Green New Deal is about.	0
1137	SANDERS	It's a bold idea.	0
1138	SANDERS	We can create millions of good-paying jobs.	0
1139	SANDERS	We can rebuild communities in rural America that have been devastated.	0
1140	SANDERS	So we are not anti-worker.	0
1141	SANDERS	We are going to provide and make sure that those workers have a transition, new jobs, healthcare and education.	0
1142	BASH	Thank you, Senator.	0
1143	BULLOCK	And look ...	0
1144	BASH	Governor Bullock, your response?	0
1145	BULLOCK	And look, Bernie, I was a union side labor lawyer.	0
1146	BULLOCK	I fought day after day, and I know - but we've set this is a false choice far too often.	0
1147	BULLOCK	Are we going to actually address climate change?	0
1148	BULLOCK	Fire seasons are 80 days longer in the west now.	0
1149	BULLOCK	Or are we going to give people a better shot at a better life?	0
1150	BULLOCK	You can do both, but let's actually have the scientists drive this.	0
1151	BULLOCK	Let's not just talk about plans that are written for press releases that will go nowhere else if we can't get a Republican to acknowledge ...	0
1152	BASH	Thank you, Governor.	0
1153	BULLOCK	... that the climate's changing.	0
1154	BASH	Congressman O'Rourke, your response?	0
1155	O'ROURKE	I've listen to the sciences on this, and they're very clear.	0
1156	O'ROURKE	We don't have more than 10 years to get this right, and we won't meet that challenge with half-steps or half-measures or only half the country.	0
1157	O'ROURKE	We've got to bring everyone in.	0
1158	O'ROURKE	The people of Detroit and those that I listened to in Flint last week, they want the challenge.	0
1159	O'ROURKE	They want those jobs.	0
1160	O'ROURKE	They want to create the future for this country and the world.	0
1161	O'ROURKE	Those community college students that I met in Tucumcari, New Mexico understand that wind and solar jobs are the fastest-growing jobs in the country.	0
1162	O'ROURKE	And those farmers in Iowa say pay me for the environmental services of planting cover crops and keeping more land in conservation easements.	0
1163	O'ROURKE	That's how we meet the challenge.	0
1164	O'ROURKE	We do it with everyone in this country.	0
1165	O'ROURKE	We bring everyone in to the solution.	0
1166	BASH	Thank you, Congressman.	0
1167	BASH	Mayor Buttigieg, your response?	0
1168	BUTTIGIEG	We have all put out highly similar visions on climate.	0
1169	BUTTIGIEG	It is all theoretical.	0
1170	BUTTIGIEG	We will deal with climate, if and only if we win the presidency, if and only if we beat Donald Trump.	0
1171	BUTTIGIEG	Nominate me, and you get to see the president of the United States stand next to an American war veteran and explain why he chose to pretend to be disabled when it was chance to serve.	0
1172	BUTTIGIEG	Nominate me, and we will have a different conversation with American voters about why the president of the United States thinks you're a sucker, when the problem in your life is your paycheck is not going up nearly as fast as the cost of housing or the cost of education ...	0
1173	BASH	Thank you.	0
1174	BUTTIGIEG	... or the cost of prescription drugs.	0
1175	BUTTIGIEG	And he has done nothing about it except ...	0
1176	BASH	Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.	0
1177	BUTTIGIEG	... the tax cuts for the corporations.	0
1178	BASH	Hi, Senator Klobuchar.	0
1179	BASH	I want to ask you about something that CNN heard from a Michigan Democratic primary voter, but we’re reaching out and getting their questions.	0
1180	BASH	Kimber from Birmingham, Michigan has this question, “what is your plan to address infrastructure, including the water issue so another Flint, Michigan does not happen again?”	0
1181	KLOBUCHAR	Thank you Dana, and I was just in Flint.	0
1182	KLOBUCHAR	And they are still drinking bottled water in that town and that is outrageous.	0
1183	KLOBUCHAR	So my plan, and I am the first one that came out with an infrastructure plan and I did that because this is a bread and butter issue.	0
1184	KLOBUCHAR	It's a bread and butter issue for people that are caught in traffic jams.	0
1185	KLOBUCHAR	I think the Governor here in Michigan smartly ran on the slogan, “fix the damn roads,” and it is an issue for union jobs.	0
1186	KLOBUCHAR	And so I think what we need to do is not have a president that’s promised he was going to do that on election night, if anyone remembers.	0
1187	KLOBUCHAR	And then he hasn’t followed through -- he has done nothing, he blew up a meeting at the White House.	0
1188	KLOBUCHAR	I would put $1 trillion in to this, and I would pay for it by first of all changing the capital gains rate by doing something when it comes to that regressive tax bill that left everyone behind, but really made his Mar-a-Lago friends richer as he promised.	0
1189	KLOBUCHAR	And I would take that money and put it in to rural broadband and green infrastructure so you won't have what you just saw in Detroit with the Jefferson Chalmers neighborhood, the African neighborhood -- that was African-American neighborhood that was most-hit when you had those recent rainstorms.	0
1190	KLOBUCHAR	And I truly believe that if we're going to move on infrastructure --	0
1191	BASH	Thank you --	0
1192	KLOBUCHAR	And climate change, you need a voice from the Heartlands.	0
1193	BASH	Is this -- thank you Senator Klobuchar, Ms. Williamson, what's your response on the Flint water crisis?	0
1194	WILLIAMSON	My response on the Flint water crisis is that Flint is just the tip of the iceberg.	0
1195	WILLIAMSON	I was recently in Denmark, South Carolina where it is -- there is a lot of talk about it being the next Flint.	0
1196	WILLIAMSON	We have an administration that has gutted the Clean Water Act.	0
1197	WILLIAMSON	We have communities, particularly communities of color and disadvantaged communities all over this country who are suffering from environmental injustice.	0
1198	WILLIAMSON	I assure you, I lived Grosse Pointe -- what happened in Flint would not have happened in Grosse Pointe.	0
1199	WILLIAMSON	This is part of the dark underbelly of American society.	0
1200	WILLIAMSON	The racism, the bigotry, and the entire conversation that we’re having here tonight -- if you think any of this wonkiness is going to deal with this dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred that this president is bringing up in this country, then I’m afraid that the Democrats are going to see some very dark days.	0
1201	WILLIAMSON	We need to say it like it is, it's bigger than Flint -- it's all over this country, it's particularly people of color -- it's particularly people who do not have the money to fight back.	0
1202	WILLIAMSON	And if the Democrats don't start saying it, then why would those people feel that they're there for us and if those people don't feel it, they won't vote for us, and Donald Trump will win.	0
1203	LEMON	Thank you very much Ms. Williamson.	0
1204	WILLIAMSON	Thank you.	0
1205	LEMON	We want to turn now to the issue of race in America.	0
1206	LEMON	Congressman O'Rourke, President Trump is pursuing a reelection strategy based in part, on racial division.	0
1207	LEMON	How do you convince primary voters that you'd be the best nominee to take on President Trump and heal the racial divide in America?	0
1208	O'ROURKE	We'll call his racism out for what it is, and also talk about its consequences.	0
1209	O'ROURKE	It doesn't just offend our sensibilities to hear him say "send her back," about a member of Congress, because she's a woman color, because she's a Muslim-American doesn't just offend our sensibilities when he calls Mexican immigrants "rapists and criminals," or seeks to ban all Muslims from the shores of a country that's comprised of people from the world over, from every tradition of faith.	0
1210	O'ROURKE	It is also changing this country.	0
1211	O'ROURKE	Hate crimes are in the rise -- every single one of the last three years, on the day that he signed his executive order attempting to ban Muslim travel, the mosque in Victoria, Texas was burned to the ground.	0
1212	O'ROURKE	So we must not only stand up against Donald Trump and defeat him in this next election, but we must also ensure that we don't just tolerate or respect our differences, but we embrace them.	0
1213	O'ROURKE	That's what we've learned in El Passo, Texas -- my hometown.	0
1214	O'ROURKE	One of the safest cities in the United States of America, not despite, but because it's a city of immigrants and asylum seekers, and refugees.	0
1215	O'ROURKE	We will show that our diversity --	0
1216	LEMON	Thank you.	0
1217	LEMON	O'ROURKE Is our strength in my administration.	0
1218	LEMON	Congressman O'Rourke, thank you very much.	0
1219	LEMON	Governor Hickenlooper, why are you the best nominee to heal the racial divide in America, please respond.	0
1220	HICKENLOOPER	Well the core value behind this entire country's history is working towards a more perfect union, that all people are created equal.	0
1221	HICKENLOOPER	And we've fallen far away from that.	0
1222	HICKENLOOPER	I think the job is incumbent on any one of us to make the convincing case that we can deliver an urban agenda that represents progress in schools.	0
1223	HICKENLOOPER	In Colorado when I was Mayor we got universal pre-K for every kid in the urban city.	0
1224	HICKENLOOPER	We did major police reform 10 years before Ferguson -- why is it now that five years after Ferguson we still don't have anything?	0
1225	HICKENLOOPER	How do we get affordable housing?	0
1226	HICKENLOOPER	We created a scholarship fund for every kid -- you've got to deliver a vision like that for the whole country.	0
1227	LEMON	Thank you Governor.	0
1228	LEMON	Senator Warren, I’m coming to you now.	0
1229	LEMON	Last week the FBI Director Christopher Wray said that the majority of domestic terrorism cases this year have been motivated by white supremacy.	0
1230	LEMON	In fact, the alleged shooter in this weekend’s attack in Gilroy, California referenced a well-known white supremacist book on social media.	0
1231	LEMON	How are you going to combat the rise of white supremacy?	0
1232	WARREN	We need to call out white supremacy for what it is: domestic terrorism.	0
1233	WARREN	And it poses a threat to the United States of America.	0
1234	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1235	WARREN	We live in a country now where the president is advancing environmental racism, economic racism, criminal justice racism, health care racism.	0
1236	WARREN	The way we do better is to fight back and show something better.	0
1237	WARREN	So I have a plan, for example, on education that says we have to build a better education system for all our kids, but we've got to acknowledge what's happened on race.	0
1238	WARREN	So my plan has universal, tuition-free college for all of our kids, but also increases the Pell Grants and levels the playing field by putting $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities.	0
1239	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1240	WARREN	It cancels student loan debt for 95 percent of the kids with student loan debt and helps close the black-white wealth gap in America.	0
1241	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1242	LEMON	Thank you, Senator, very much.	0
1243	LEMON	Mayor Buttigieg, you have been criticized for your handling of racial issues in your home city of South Bend, from diversity in the police force to housing policy.	0
1244	LEMON	Given your record, how can you convince African-Americans that you should be the Democratic nominee?	0
1245	BUTTIGIEG	As an urban mayor serving a diverse community, the racial divide lives within me.	0
1246	BUTTIGIEG	I'm not saying that I became mayor and racism or crime or poverty ended on my watch.	0
1247	BUTTIGIEG	But in our city, we have come together repeatedly to tackle challenges, like the fact that far too many people were not getting the help they needed in their housing and so we directed it to a historically underinvested African-American neighborhood.	0
1248	BUTTIGIEG	Right now, in the wake of a police-involved shooting, our community is moving from hurting to healing by making sure that the community can participate in things like revising the use of force policy and making sure there are community voices on the board of safety that handles police matters.	0
1249	BUTTIGIEG	I've proposed a Douglass plan to tackle this issue nationally, because mayors have hit the limits of what you can do unless there is national action.	0
1250	BUTTIGIEG	Systemic racism has touched every part of American life, from housing to health to homeownership.	0
1251	BUTTIGIEG	If you walk into an emergency room and you are black, your reports of pain will be taken less seriously.	0
1252	BUTTIGIEG	If you apply for a job and you are black, you are less likely to be called just because of the name on the resume.	0
1253	BUTTIGIEG	It's why I've proposed that we do everything from investing in historically red-lined neighborhoods...	0
1254	LEMON	Mayor...	0
1255	BUTTIGIEG	... to build black wealth in homeownership...	0
1256	LEMON	Thank you, Mayor.	0
1257	BUTTIGIEG	... to supporting entrepreneurship for black Americans.	0
1258	LEMON	Thank you very much.	0
1259	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1260	LEMON	Senator Klobuchar, what do you say to those Trump voters who prioritize the economy over the president's bigotry?	0
1261	KLOBUCHAR	Well, first of all, there are people that voted for Donald Trump before that aren't racist; they just wanted a better shake in the economy.	0
1262	KLOBUCHAR	And so I would appeal to them.	0
1263	KLOBUCHAR	But I don't think anyone can justify what this president is doing.	0
1264	KLOBUCHAR	Little kids literally woke up this weekend, turned on the TV, and saw their president calling their city, the town of Baltimore, nothing more than a home for rats.	0
1265	KLOBUCHAR	And I can tell you, as your president, that will stop.	0
1266	KLOBUCHAR	The second thing I would say is that economic opportunity means economic opportunity for everyone in this country.	0
1267	KLOBUCHAR	I know that because I have lived it.	0
1268	KLOBUCHAR	And that means when we put out there better childcare and better education, and we pay teachers more, and we make sure there's a decent retirement system in place, yes, we help the African-American community and we must, because they have been the ones that have been most hurt by what we've seen in the last decades, but we help everyone.	0
1269	KLOBUCHAR	So what I say to the people in my rural parts of my state, just like I say to them in the city and bring them together, is that economic opportunity must be there for everyone.	0
1270	LEMON	Senator Klobuchar, thank you very much.	0
1271	LEMON	Congressman O'Rourke, please respond.	0
1272	O'ROURKE	I want to acknowledge something that we're all touching on, which is the very foundation of this country, the wealth that we have built, the way we became the greatest country on the face of the planet was literally on the backs of those who were kidnapped and brought here by force.	0
1273	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1274	O'ROURKE	The legacy of slavery and segregation and Jim Crow and suppression is alive and well in every aspect of the economy and in the country.	0
1275	O'ROURKE	Today, as president, I will sign into law a new Voting Rights Act.	0
1276	O'ROURKE	I will focus on education, address health care disparities, but I will also sign into law Sheila Jackson Lee's reparations bill so that we can have the national conversation we've waited too long in this country to have.	0
1277	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1278	LEMON	Thank you, Congressman O'Rourke.	0
1279	LEMON	Speaking of reparations, Ms. Williamson, many of your opponents support a commission to study the issue of reparations for slavery.	0
1280	LEMON	But you are calling for up to $500 billion in financial assistance.	0
1281	LEMON	What makes you qualified to determine how much is owed in reparations?	0
1282	WILLIAMSON	Well, first of all, it's not $500 billion in financial assistance.	0
1283	WILLIAMSON	It's $500 billion, $200 billion to $500 billion payment of a debt that is owed.	0
1284	WILLIAMSON	That is what reparations is.	0
1285	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1286	WILLIAMSON	We need some deep truth-telling when it comes.	0
1287	WILLIAMSON	We don't need another commission to look at evidence.	0
1288	WILLIAMSON	I appreciate what Congressman O'Rourke has said.	0
1289	WILLIAMSON	It is time for us to simply realize that this country will not heal.	0
1290	WILLIAMSON	All that a country is, is a collection of people.	0
1291	WILLIAMSON	People heal when there's some deep truth-telling.	0
1292	WILLIAMSON	We need to recognize that when it comes to the economic gap between blacks and whites in America, it does come from a great injustice that has never been dealt with.	0
1293	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1294	WILLIAMSON	That great injustice has had to do with the fact that there was 250 years of slavery followed by another hundred years of domestic terrorism.	0
1295	WILLIAMSON	What makes me qualified to say $200 billion to $500 billion?	0
1296	WILLIAMSON	I’ll tell you what makes me qualified.	0
1297	WILLIAMSON	If you did the math of the 40 acres and a mule, given that there was 4 million to 5 million slaves at the end of the Civil War, four to five -- and they were all promised 40 acres and a mule for every family of four, if you did the math today, it would be trillions of dollars.	0
1298	WILLIAMSON	And I believe that anything less than $100 billion is an insult.	0
1299	WILLIAMSON	And I believe that $200 billion to $500 billion is politically feasible today, because so many Americans realize there is an injustice that continues to form a toxicity underneath the surface, an emotional turbulence that only reparations will heal.	0
1300	LEMON	Thank you very much.	0
1301	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1302	LEMON	Senator Sanders -- Senator Sanders, you don't think cash payments are the best way to address this issue, but according to a new Gallup poll, 73 percent of African-Americans are in favor of cash payments to black Americans who are descendants of slaves.	0
1303	LEMON	How do you respond to them?	0
1304	SANDERS	Well, I respond to that by saying that I am supportive of Jim Clyburn's legislation, which is called 10-20-30.	0
1305	SANDERS	And what that understands is that as a result of slavery, and segregation, and the institutional racism we see now in health care, in education, in financial services, we are going to have to focus big time on rebuilding distressed communities in America, including African-American communities.	0
1306	SANDERS	In terms of education, I also have a plan.	0
1307	SANDERS	It's called the Thurgood Marshall Plan.	0
1308	SANDERS	And it would focus on ending the growth of segregated schools in America.	0
1309	SANDERS	It would triple funding for Title I schools.	0
1310	SANDERS	It would make sure that teachers in this country earned at least $60,000 a year.	0
1311	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1312	LEMON	Senator Sanders, thank you very much.	0
1313	LEMON	The debate continues right after this short break.	0
1314	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1315	LEMON	Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate, live from Detroit.	0
1316	LEMON	Let's turn now to the economy.	0
1317	LEMON	Congressman Ryan, President Trump's tariffs have boosted the U.S. steel industry but hurt auto manufacturers like those here in Michigan, which could drive up the cost of cars.	0
1318	LEMON	As president, would you continue President Trump's steel tariffs?	0
1319	RYAN	Look, I think President Trump was onto something when he talked about China.	0
1320	RYAN	China has been abusing the economic system for a long time.	0
1321	RYAN	They steal intellectual property.	0
1322	RYAN	They subsidize goods coming into this country.	0
1323	RYAN	They've displaced steel workers, auto workers, across the board, eroded our manufacturing.	0
1324	RYAN	And we basically transferred our wealth of our middle class either up to the top 1 percent or to China for them to build their military.	0
1325	RYAN	So I think we need some targeted response against China.	0
1326	RYAN	But you know how you beat China?	0
1327	RYAN	You out-compete 'em.	0
1328	RYAN	And that's why I'd put a chief manufacturing officer in place to make sure that we rebuild the manufacturing base.	0
1329	RYAN	We've got to fill these factories that -- in Detroit, in Youngstown, that used to make cars and steel.	0
1330	RYAN	We've got to fill them with workers who are making electric vehicles, batteries, charging stations, make sure they're making solar panels.	0
1331	RYAN	As I said earlier, China dominates 60 percent of the solar panel market.	0
1332	RYAN	They dominate 50 percent to 60 percent of the electric vehicle market.	0
1333	RYAN	We're going to make 10 million electric vehicle somewhere in the world in the next 10 years.	0
1334	RYAN	I want them made in the United States.	0
1335	RYAN	That's why I have a chief manufacturing officer that will sit in the White House and help drive this agenda.	0
1336	LEMON	Congressman, thank you.	0
1337	LEMON	Just as a point of clarification, as president, would you consider President Trump's steel tariffs, yes or no?	0
1338	RYAN	Well, I would have to re-evaluate.	0
1339	RYAN	I think some of them are effective.	0
1340	RYAN	But he's bungled the whole thing, obviously.	0
1341	RYAN	He has -- see, here's the problem with President Trump.	0
1342	RYAN	He has a tactical move -- one of many -- he has a tactical move.	0
1343	RYAN	What's the grand strategy for the United States?	0
1344	RYAN	China has 100-year plan, a 50-year plan, a 30-year plan, a 20-year plan.	0
1345	RYAN	We live in a 24-hour news cycle.	0
1346	RYAN	That spells disaster for our economy and disaster for our global politics.	0
1347	LEMON	Thank you, Congressman.	0
1348	LEMON	Congressman Delaney, your response?	0
1349	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1350	DELANEY	So, listen.	0
1351	DELANEY	This is what I don’t understand.	0
1352	DELANEY	President Trump wants to build physical walls and beats up on immigrants.	0
1353	DELANEY	Most of the folks running for president want to build economic walls to free trade and beat up on President Obama.	0
1354	DELANEY	I’m the only one running for president who actually supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
1355	DELANEY	President Obama was right about that.	0
1356	DELANEY	We should be getting back in that.	0
1357	DELANEY	Senator Warren just issued a trade plan...	0
1358	WARREN	You bet I did.	0
1359	DELANEY	... that would prevent the United States from trading with its allies.	0
1360	DELANEY	We can't go and -- we can't isolate ourselves from the world.	0
1361	DELANEY	We have to engage...	0
1362	LEMON	Thank you.	0
1363	DELANEY	... with fair, rules-based trade.	0
1364	LEMON	Thank you, Congressman Delaney.	0
1365	LEMON	Senator Warren, please respond.	0
1366	WARREN	You know, for decades, we have had a trade policy that has been written by giant multi-national corporations to help giant multi-national corporations.	0
1367	WARREN	They have no loyalty to America.	0
1368	WARREN	They have no patriotism.	0
1369	WARREN	If they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico, they'll do it in a heartbeat.	0
1370	WARREN	If they can continue a polluting plant by moving it to Vietnam, they'll do it in a heartbeat.	0
1371	WARREN	I have put out a new comprehensive plan that says we're not going to do it that way.	0
1372	WARREN	We're going to negotiate our deals with unions at the table, with small businesses at the table, with small farmers at the table, with environmentalists at the table, with human rights activists at the table.	0
1373	WARREN	And then, we're going to use the fact that everybody in the world wants to get to America's markets.	0
1374	WARREN	They want to sell to you...	0
1375	DELANEY	That was the TPP.	0
1376	WARREN	I'll finish.	0
1377	LEMON	Congressman Delaney...	0
1378	WARREN	... is everyone wants to get to America's markets.	0
1379	LEMON	Thank you, Senator.	0
1380	WARREN	No.	0
1381	WARREN	So the question is...	0
1382	LEMON	Senator, thank you.	0
1383	LEMON	Please abide by the rules.	0
1384	WARREN	... how we need to raise our standards.	0
1385	LEMON	Congressman Delaney, it's your turn.	0
1386	LEMON	Thank you, Senator.	0
1387	LEMON	Congressman Delaney?	0
1388	DELANEY	So that was the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
1389	DELANEY	I think President Obama was right.	0
1390	DELANEY	He did include environmental standards.	0
1391	DELANEY	He did include labor standards.	0
1392	DELANEY	We would be in an entirely different position with China if we had entered the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
1393	DELANEY	We can't isolate ourselves from the world.	0
1394	DELANEY	We can't isolate ourselves from Asia.	0
1395	DELANEY	Senator Warren's plan, basically, that she put out, we would not be able to trade with the United Kingdom.	0
1396	WARREN	No, what this is about...	0
1397	DELANEY	We would not be able to trade with the E.U.	0
1398	DELANEY	It is so extreme that it will isolate...	0
1399	LEMON	Thank you, Congressman Delaney.	0
1400	LEMON	Thank you, Congressman.	0
1401	DELANEY	... the American economy from the world.	0
1402	LEMON	Senator?	0
1403	LEMON	Senator Warren.	0
1404	LEMON	Senator Warren.	0
1405	SANDERS	I was...	0
1406	WARREN	I think he said...	0
1407	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1408	LEMON	Senator Sanders, please let Senator Warren respond.	0
1409	SANDERS	Oh, I'm sorry.	0
1410	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1411	WARREN	What the congressman is describing as extreme is having deals that are negotiated by American workers for American workers.	0
1412	WARREN	American workers want those jobs, and we can build the trade deals that do it.	0
1413	WARREN	People want access to our markets all around the world.	0
1414	WARREN	Then the answer is, let's make them raise their standards.	0
1415	WARREN	Make them pay workers more.	0
1416	WARREN	Let their workers unionize.	0
1417	WARREN	Raise their environmental standards before they come to us and say they want to be able to sell their products.	0
1418	WARREN	Right now, the whole game is working for the big multinationals.	0
1419	WARREN	It's just not working for the people here in the United States, and we can change that.	0
1420	LEMON	Senator, thank you very much.	0
1421	LEMON	Congressman O'Rourke, your response?	0
1422	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1423	O'ROURKE	You know, the question was about tariffs.	0
1424	O'ROURKE	And they're a huge mistake.	0
1425	O'ROURKE	They constitute the largest tax increase on the American consumer, hitting the middle class and the working poor especially hard, and farmers in Iowa and across the country are bearing the brunt of the consequences.	0
1426	O'ROURKE	When have we ever gone to war, including a trade war, without allies and friends and partners?	0
1427	O'ROURKE	As president, we will hold China accountable, but we will bring our allies and friends, like the European Union, to bear, and we'll also negotiate trade deals that favor farmers and American workers and protect human rights and the environment and labor, not just here in the United States...	0
1428	LEMON	Congressman O'Rourke, thank you so much.	0
1429	LEMON	Senator Sanders, please respond to Congressman O'Rourke.	0
1430	WARREN	I'd like to respond to this.	0
1431	SANDERS	Yeah, OK. You're looking, I believe, at the only member of Congress who not only voted against these disastrous trade agreements, NAFTA, PNTR with China, which cost us over 4 million jobs, but also helped lead the effort against these agreements.	0
1432	SANDERS	Now, Elizabeth is absolutely right.	0
1433	SANDERS	If anybody here thinks that corporate America gives one damn about the average American worker, you're mistaken.	0
1434	SANDERS	If they can save five cents by going to China, Mexico, or Vietnam, or anyplace else, that's exactly what they will do.	0
1435	SANDERS	As president, let me tell you what I will do.	0
1436	SANDERS	These guys line up at the federal trough.	0
1437	SANDERS	They want military contracts.	0
1438	SANDERS	They want all kinds of contracts.	0
1439	SANDERS	Well, under my administration, you ain't going to get those contracts if you're throwing American workers out on the street.	0
1440	LEMON	Senator Sanders, thank you very much.	0
1441	LEMON	Governor Hickenlooper, your response?	0
1442	WARREN	I'd like a chance to respond.	0
1443	HICKENLOOPER	So -- so I think -- again, I think Congressman Delaney has got a point here.	0
1444	HICKENLOOPER	And there is a way of looking at trade that is therapeutic.	0
1445	HICKENLOOPER	The bottom line is, you talk to any economist, there is not a single example in history where a trade war had a winner.	0
1446	HICKENLOOPER	Trade wars are for losers.	0
1447	HICKENLOOPER	And the bottom line is we've got to recognize, let's negotiate a better trade deal.	0
1448	HICKENLOOPER	But you're not going to win against China in a trade war when they've got 25 percent of our total debt.	0
1449	HICKENLOOPER	And step back and look it.	0
1450	HICKENLOOPER	Here's Trump gives a giant tax cut and at the same time -- so we're paying in tariffs about $800 to $1,200 per household and then we give this incredible tax cut to the rich.	0
1451	HICKENLOOPER	Essentially what's happening is now he's transferred that tax obligation onto the middle class.	0
1452	HICKENLOOPER	That's what's outrageous.	0
1453	HICKENLOOPER	But tariffs are not the solution.	0
1454	LEMON	Governor, thank you.	0
1455	LEMON	Senator Warren?	0
1456	WARREN	Anyone who thinks that these trade deals are mostly about tariffs just doesn’t understand what’s going on.	0
1457	WARREN	Look at the new NAFTA 2.0.	0
1458	WARREN	What’s the central feature?	0
1459	WARREN	It’s to help pharmaceutical companies get longer periods of exclusivity so they can charge Canadians, Americans, and Mexicans more money and make more profits.	0
1460	WARREN	That's what trade deals have become.	0
1461	WARREN	They have become a way for giant multinationals to change the regulatory environment so they can suck more profits out for themselves and to leave the American people behind.	0
1462	WARREN	We have to have the courage to fight back against that corruption.	0
1463	LEMON	Senator, thank you.	0
1464	LEMON	Governor Bullock, your response?	0
1465	BULLOCK	You know, a farmer in Rippy said to me, every time that Trump tweets, we lose hundreds of thousands of dollars.	0
1466	BULLOCK	If Montana had to eat all the wheat that we produce, every Montanan would have to eat 40 loaves of bread a day.	0
1467	BULLOCK	But by the same token, what we have is -- I actually agree with Senator Warren on this in part.	0
1468	BULLOCK	Corporations can move capital easy.	0
1469	BULLOCK	Workers can't move.	0
1470	BULLOCK	So going forward, we need to make sure that our trade deals actually are protecting -- thinking about the workers.	0
1471	BULLOCK	They can't be the stepchild.	0
1472	BULLOCK	But the way to do it, with this blunt instrument of tariffs that the president is doing, that's not how we get a fair deal for farmers anywhere or the manufacturers here in Detroit.	0
1473	LEMON	Governor, thank you very much.	0
1474	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1475	LEMON	Mayor -- standby, please.	0
1476	LEMON	Standby, please.	0
1477	LEMON	Please abide by the rules.	0
1478	LEMON	Mayor Buttigieg, on Thursday of this week, a GM plant in Michigan will stop production, the latest auto plant to cease operations in the industrial Midwest.	0
1479	LEMON	This comes as part of the company's modernization plans, which will eventually result in 6,000 hourly workers losing their jobs or being reassigned to other plants.	0
1480	LEMON	What is your plan for retraining workers whose jobs are at risk?	0
1481	BUTTIGIEG	Well, this happened in my community 20 years before I was born.	0
1482	BUTTIGIEG	And when I was growing up, we were still picking up the pieces.	0
1483	BUTTIGIEG	Empty factories, empty houses, poverty.	0
1484	BUTTIGIEG	I know exactly what happens to a community when these closures take place.	0
1485	BUTTIGIEG	And there will be more.	0
1486	BUTTIGIEG	It's why we actually need to put the interests of workers first.	0
1487	BUTTIGIEG	Of course we need to do retraining.	0
1488	BUTTIGIEG	We're doing it now in South Bend.	0
1489	BUTTIGIEG	We should continue to do it.	0
1490	BUTTIGIEG	But this is so much bigger than a trade fight.	0
1491	BUTTIGIEG	This is about a moment when the economy is changing before our eyes.	0
1492	BUTTIGIEG	There are people in the gig economy who go through more jobs in a week than my parents went through in their lifetime.	0
1493	BUTTIGIEG	It's why I've proposed that we allow gig workers to unionize, because a gig is a job and a worker is a worker.	0
1494	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1495	LEMON	Thank you, Mayor.	0
1496	BUTTIGIEG	We have to respond to all of these changes.	0
1497	BUTTIGIEG	And, you know, in addition to confronting tech, in addition to supporting workers by double unionization, as I propose to do, some of this is low-tech, too, like the minimum wage is just too low.	0
1498	BUTTIGIEG	And so-called conservative Christian senators right now in the Senate are blocking a bill to raise the minimum wage, when scripture says that whoever oppresses the poor taunts their maker.	0
1499	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1500	LEMON	Mayor, thank you very much.	0
1501	LEMON	Congressman Delaney, I'm coming to you now.	0
1502	LEMON	Your estimated net worth is more than $65 million.	0
1503	LEMON	That would make you subject to Senator Warren's proposed wealth tax on the assets of the richest 75,000 homes, households, or so, in the United States.	0
1504	LEMON	Do you think Senator Warren's wealth tax is a fair way to fund child care and education?	0
1505	DELANEY	I think wealthy Americans have to pay more.	0
1506	DELANEY	Listen, I grew up in a blue-collar family.	0
1507	DELANEY	First in my family to go to college.	0
1508	DELANEY	Became a successful entrepreneur.	0
1509	DELANEY	Created thousands of jobs.	0
1510	DELANEY	Supported thousands of entrepreneurs all around this country.	0
1511	DELANEY	And I've done well financially.	0
1512	DELANEY	I think I should pay more in tax.	0
1513	DELANEY	I think wealthy Americans should pay more in tax.	0
1514	DELANEY	But we have to have a real solution.	0
1515	DELANEY	The real solution is to raise the capital gains rates.	0
1516	DELANEY	There is no reason why people who invest for a living should pay less than people who work for a living.	0
1517	DELANEY	That’s ridiculous.	0
1518	DELANEY	It’s the biggest loophole in our tax code.	0
1519	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1520	DELANEY	We act like wealthy individuals are endangered species and if we don't raise -- if we raise their taxes, they won't invest.	0
1521	DELANEY	That's crazy.	0
1522	DELANEY	That's how we get more revenues from wealthy individuals, we roll back the Trump tax cuts to wealthy individuals.	0
1523	DELANEY	I think the wealth tax will be fought in court forever.	0
1524	DELANEY	It's arguably unconstitutional.	0
1525	DELANEY	And the countries that have had it have largely abandoned it because it's impossible to implement.	0
1526	DELANEY	But here again, real solutions, not impossible promises.	0
1527	LEMON	Congressman, thank you very much.	0
1528	DELANEY	Raise the capital gains tax.	0
1529	DELANEY	Roll back the taxes on wealthy Americans.	0
1530	LEMON	Thank you, Congressman.	0
1531	DELANEY	That we can do in our first few months as president.	0
1532	LEMON	Senator Warren, please respond.	0
1533	WARREN	So I have proposed a wealth tax.	0
1534	WARREN	It's now time to do that.	0
1535	WARREN	It's time to tax the top one tenth of one percent of fortunes in this country.	0
1536	WARREN	Your first $50 million, you can keep free and clear.	0
1537	WARREN	But your 50 millionth and first dollar, you got to pitch in two cents.	0
1538	WARREN	Two cents.	0
1539	WARREN	What can America do with two cents?	0
1540	WARREN	We can provide universal childcare from zero to five.	1
1541	WARREN	We can provide universal pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old.	1
1542	WARREN	We can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country.	1
1543	WARREN	We can provide universal tuition-free college.	1
1544	WARREN	We can expand Pell.	0
1545	WARREN	We can put $50 billion into our historically black colleges and universities.	0
1546	WARREN	And we can cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the people who have it and start to close the wealth gap in America.	0
1547	WARREN	It tells you how badly broken this economy is...	0
1548	LEMON	Senator, thank you very much.	0
1549	LEMON	Congressman Delaney...	0
1550	WARREN	... that two cents from the wealthiest in this country...	0
1551	LEMON	Thank you, Senator.	0
1552	WARREN	... would let us invest in the rest of America.	0
1553	LEMON	Senator, please.	0
1554	LEMON	Congressman, please respond.	0
1555	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1556	DELANEY	This is not about whether wealthy -- this is not about whether wealthy Americans should pay more.	0
1557	DELANEY	I think we're all in agreement on that.	0
1558	DELANEY	It's a question of, do you have a real solution to make it happen?	0
1559	DELANEY	We can raise the capital gains rate to match the ordinary income.	0
1560	DELANEY	You know the last president to do that was actually Ronald Reagan.	0
1561	DELANEY	We can do that in our first year.	0
1562	DELANEY	I've called for that to be done (inaudible).	0
1563	DELANEY	I've called for the expansion of universal pre-K so that every American has pre-K. And I do it through a -- through an additional tax on high net worth individuals.	0
1564	BASH	Thank you.	0
1565	BASH	But we don't need to come up with new taxes that are arguably unconstitutional...	0
1566	BASH	Thank you, Congressman Delaney.	0
1567	DELANEY	... will be fought in court for years.	0
1568	BASH	Thank you, Congressman.	0
1569	BASH	I want to turn to the issue of student debt.	0
1570	WARREN	This is...	0
1571	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1572	SANDERS	Can I just respond to that?	0
1573	BASH	I'm going to turn to the issue of student debt now.	0
1574	BASH	Mayor Buttigieg, you've talked about how you and your husband are...	0
1575	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1576	BASH	... paying down six figures of student loan debt.	0
1577	BASH	Under Senator Sanders' proposal to cancel all student loan debt, yours would immediately be wiped away.	0
1578	BASH	Why wouldn't you support that?	0
1579	BUTTIGIEG	That would be great for us.	0
1580	BUTTIGIEG	And then the next day, there would be a student loan program and people would be out taking student loans wondering they weren't -- why they weren't lucky enough in timing to get theirs wiped away completely, too.	0
1581	BUTTIGIEG	We can have debt-free college for low and middle-income students by expanding Pell Grants and compelling states to pick up more of the burden.	0
1582	BUTTIGIEG	And on the back end, for those of us who do have a lot of debt, we can make it more affordable and we can expand a public service loan forgiveness program, which is an excellent program that is almost impossible to actually get access to right now.	0
1583	BUTTIGIEG	We can take these steps and have an approach that is actually fair.	0
1584	BUTTIGIEG	If we want to start wiping away student debt, here's where I would start.	0
1585	BUTTIGIEG	I would start with the for-profit colleges that took advantage of people, especially veterans, by the way.	0
1586	BUTTIGIEG	The moment I redeployed, my Facebook add feed started filling with ads from these for-profit colleges.	0
1587	BUTTIGIEG	Under President Obama, they were held accountable for whether they delivered results.	0
1588	BUTTIGIEG	President Trump, under a secretary of education who regrettably is from this state, did away with those rules.	0
1589	BUTTIGIEG	There's no accountability.	0
1590	BUTTIGIEG	On my watch, those colleges that turned the Department of Education into a predatory lender, that's where we would begin when it came to getting rid of loans.	0
1591	BASH	Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.	0
1592	BASH	Senator Sanders, you want to forgive all student loan debt.	0
1593	BASH	Your response?	0
1594	SANDERS	Matter of fact, I do.	0
1595	SANDERS	But before I get into that, the major issue that we don't talk about in Congress; you don't talk about in the media, is the massive level of income and wealth inequality in America.	0
1596	SANDERS	You’ve got three people who own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent.	0
1597	SANDERS	You have a top 1 percent that owns more wealth than the bottom 92 percent.	0
1598	SANDERS	Forty-nine percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent.	0
1599	SANDERS	Companies like Amazon and billionaires out there do not pay one nickel in federal income tax.	0
1600	SANDERS	And we’ve got 500,000 people sleeping out on the street.	0
1601	SANDERS	What we need is a political revolution that tells these billionaires and corporate America that they are Americans; they'll participate in our society, but they have got to start paying their fair share of taxes, period.	0
1602	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1603	BASH	Thank you, Senator Sanders.	0
1604	BASH	Ms. Williamson?	0
1605	WILLIAMSON	I'd like to respond.	0
1606	BASH	You are proposing to make college free for all qualified students.	0
1607	BASH	Should the government pay for children from wealthier families to go to college?	0
1608	WILLIAMSON	I think that all domestic and international policy should be based on the idea that anything we do to help people thrive is a stimulation to our economy.	0
1609	WILLIAMSON	That’s how you stimulate your economy.	0
1610	WILLIAMSON	So if a few people take advantage, but there are four or five people who were going to take the money that they then have in the bank -- when you look at this $1.5 trillion college debt -- this is why I agree with Bernie, or I would be -- OK, why don’t we swap it?	0
1611	WILLIAMSON	We had a $2 trillion tax cut, where 83 cents of every dollar goes to the very, very richest among us, that does not stimulate the economy.	0
1612	WILLIAMSON	If we get rid of this college debt, think of all the young people who will have the discretionary spending; they'll be able to start their business.	0
1613	WILLIAMSON	The best thing you could do to stimulate the U.S. economy is to get rid of this debt.	0
1614	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1615	WILLIAMSON	This is not just about a plan to to do it.	0
1616	WILLIAMSON	It’s about a philosophy of governing.	0
1617	WILLIAMSON	And I’ve heard some people here tonight, I almost wonder why you’re Democrats.	0
1618	WILLIAMSON	You seem to think there’s something wrong about using...	0
1619	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1620	WILLIAMSON	... about using the instruments of government to help people.	0
1621	WILLIAMSON	That is what government should do.	0
1622	WILLIAMSON	It should -- all policies should help people thrive.	0
1623	WILLIAMSON	That is how we will have peace...	0
1624	BASH	Thank you.	0
1625	WILLIAMSON	... and that is how we will have prosperity.	0
1626	BASH	Thank you, Ms. Williamson.	0
1627	BASH	Congressman O'Rourke, you don't support free four-year college.	0
1628	BASH	Your response to Ms. Williamson?	0
1629	O'ROURKE	I support free two-year college, earn that associate's degree, realize your full potential, debt-free four-year college.	0
1630	O'ROURKE	But unlike some of the other candidates on the stage, that's not just for tuition.	0
1631	O'ROURKE	That is room and books and board, the full cost of being able to better yourself so that you can better this country, and then for that schoolteacher who, in many places like Texas, is working a second or a third job, full forgiveness for her outstanding student loan debt, forgiveness for that person willing to work at the V.A.	0
1632	O'ROURKE	and serve our former service members.	0
1633	O'ROURKE	And we do not do that at the expense of unions.	0
1634	O'ROURKE	We elevate them as well and make it easier to join an apprenticeship to learn a skill or a trade that you can command for the rest of your life.	0
1635	BASH	Thank you.	0
1636	BASH	Thank you, Congressman.	0
1637	BASH	Senator Klobuchar, your response?	0
1638	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1639	KLOBUCHAR	I want to make it easier for kids to go to college.	0
1640	KLOBUCHAR	And I think we do it by focusing our resources on the people that need it most.	0
1641	KLOBUCHAR	And my problem with some of these plans is they literally would pay for wealthy kids, for Wall Street kids to go to college.	0
1642	KLOBUCHAR	There's no difference.	0
1643	KLOBUCHAR	It says everyone is free.	0
1644	KLOBUCHAR	I don't think that makes sense.	0
1645	KLOBUCHAR	And I'm very concerned if we do things like that, the debt we're going to pass on to the next generation and the next generation.	0
1646	KLOBUCHAR	So what I would do about student loan debt is that I would allow people to refinance it at a better rate and I would make sure that we improve those student loan repayment programs for our teachers and expand them so that you literally -- over 5, 10 years -- can get it paid for if you go into occupations where we don't have enough workers.	0
1647	KLOBUCHAR	I think we need to mesh what we were just talking about with the economy with our education policy.	0
1648	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
1649	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
1650	TAPPER	I want to turn to foreign policy now.	0
1651	TAPPER	Senator Sanders, President Trump has argued that the United States cannot continue to be the, quote, "policeman of the world."	0
1652	TAPPER	You said the exact same thing on a debate stage in 2016.	0
1653	TAPPER	If voters are hearing the same message from you and President Trump on the issue of military intervention, how should they expect that you will be any different from him?	0
1654	SANDERS	Trump is a pathological liar.	0
1655	SANDERS	I tell the truth.	0
1656	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1657	SANDERS	We have been in Afghanistan I think 18 years, in Iraq 16 or 17 years.	0
1658	SANDERS	We have spent $5 trillion on the war on terror.	0
1659	SANDERS	And there are probably more terrorists out there now than before it began.	0
1660	SANDERS	We're going to spend -- the Congress passed -- and I will not vote for -- a $715 billion military budget, more than the 10 next countries combined.	0
1661	SANDERS	What we need is a foreign policy that focuses on diplomacy, ending conflicts by people sitting at a table, not by killing each other.	0
1662	SANDERS	As president of the United States, I will go to the United Nations and not denigrate it, not attack the U.N., but bring countries together in the Middle East and all over the world to come to terms with their differences and solve those problems peacefully.	0
1663	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
1664	SANDERS	The United States cannot be the policeman of the world.	0
1665	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
1666	TAPPER	Governor Hickenlooper, how do you respond to Senator Sanders' vision for America's role in the world?	0
1667	HICKENLOOPER	Well, we share the recognition of the incredible costs.	0
1668	HICKENLOOPER	People don't realize that half the soldiers that fought in Iraq and Afghanistan were National Guard.	0
1669	HICKENLOOPER	And so I went and sent them off on their deployments, big, you know, noisy hangers, but I also mourned with their families when they didn't come back.	0
1670	HICKENLOOPER	We are able now to -- I call it constant engagement.	0
1671	HICKENLOOPER	But we should have an international diplomatic approach where we're talking to everybody, because if we're going to deal with climate change and cyber security and nuclear proliferation, we've got to be talking to everybody.	0
1672	HICKENLOOPER	And tariff wars don't work.	0
1673	TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.	0
1674	HICKENLOOPER	They're for losers.	0
1675	TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.	0
1676	TAPPER	I want to go to Congressman Ryan and I want to turn to the subject of North Korea, which just hours ago launched two short-range ballistic missiles for the second time in less than a week.	0
1677	TAPPER	Congressman, you've said that you would not meet with North Korea dictator Kim Jong-un unless you were at least close to a deal.	0
1678	TAPPER	Now, Senator Klobuchar says that she would, quote, "always be willing to meet with leaders to discuss policies."	0
1679	TAPPER	Is that view wrong?	0
1680	RYAN	Yeah, I think so.	0
1681	RYAN	I love Amy Klobuchar, but I think she's wrong on this one.	0
1682	RYAN	I don't think presidents of the United States meet with dictators.	0
1683	RYAN	We saw what just happened with President Trump.	0
1684	RYAN	He goes to the demilitarized zone with the leader of North Korea, gives him a huge photo op, gives him global credibility, because the most powerful person in the world is sitting there meeting with him, and weeks later, he’s lobbing more missiles.	0
1685	RYAN	That doesn’t make any sense.	0
1686	RYAN	We've got to demilitarize our foreign policy.	0
1687	RYAN	We've got to make sure that we are engaging these countries all the time.	0
1688	RYAN	This is very difficult work.	0
1689	RYAN	I've been in Congress 17 years.	0
1690	RYAN	I've sat on the Defense Appropriations Committee.	0
1691	RYAN	I've sat on the Armed Services Committee.	0
1692	RYAN	This is long, tedious work, much of it done outside of the eye of the TV camera.	0
1693	RYAN	And as president, you've got to monitor that and be very disciplined every day.	0
1694	RYAN	Don't go give a dictator a huge win.	0
1695	RYAN	Sit down and do your job.	0
1696	RYAN	And the same thing with what's happening in Central America.	0
1697	RYAN	He's cutting the State Department budget, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, where the migrants are coming from.	0
1698	TAPPER	Thank you, Congressman.	0
1699	RYAN	Go fix the problem at its source and use diplomacy to do it.	0
1700	TAPPER	Senator Klobuchar, your response?	0
1701	KLOBUCHAR	I think we agree.	0
1702	KLOBUCHAR	I just think you have to leave open the possibility of meeting with anyone at any place.	0
1703	KLOBUCHAR	What I don't like is how this president has handled it.	0
1704	KLOBUCHAR	You've heard of the Truman doctrine, the Monroe doctrine.	0
1705	KLOBUCHAR	He's done the go-it-alone doctrine with the rest of the world.	0
1706	KLOBUCHAR	He's taking us out of the climate change agreement, out of the Iran nuclear agreement, out of the Russian nuclear agreement, and I don't agree with that.	0
1707	KLOBUCHAR	And when he was just with Vladimir Putin at the G20, when he was asked about invading our democracy, he made a joke.	0
1708	KLOBUCHAR	Hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost their lives on the battlefield to protect our democracy and our right to vote.	0
1709	TAPPER	Thank you.	0
1710	KLOBUCHAR	Four little girls in Birmingham, Alabama, lost their life in a church at the height of the civil rights amendment.	0
1711	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
1712	KLOBUCHAR	So I do believe you meet with people, but you'd better have an agenda...	0
1713	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
1714	KLOBUCHAR	... and you better put our interests of our country first, not the Russians'.	0
1715	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.	0
1716	TAPPER	Mayor Buttigieg, you served in Afghanistan where just yesterday two U.S. servicemembers were killed.	0
1717	TAPPER	There are currently about 14,000 U.S. servicemembers in Afghanistan.	0
1718	TAPPER	You've said, quote, "One thing everybody can agree on is that we're getting out of Afghanistan."	0
1719	TAPPER	Will you withdraw all U.S. servicemembers by the end of your first year in office?	0
1720	BUTTIGIEG	We will withdraw.	0
1721	BUTTIGIEG	We have to.	0
1722	TAPPER	In your first year?	0
1723	BUTTIGIEG	Yes.	0
1724	BUTTIGIEG	Look, around the world, we will do whatever it takes to keep America safe.	0
1725	BUTTIGIEG	But I thought I was one of the last troops leaving Afghanistan when I thought I was turning out the lights years ago.	0
1726	BUTTIGIEG	Every time I see news about somebody being killed in Afghanistan, I think about what it was like to hear an explosion over there and wonder whether it was somebody that I served with, somebody that I knew, a friend, roommate, colleague.	0
1727	BUTTIGIEG	We're pretty close to the day when we will wake up to the news of a casualty in Afghanistan who was not born on 9/11.	0
1728	BUTTIGIEG	I was sent into that war by a congressional authorization, as well as a president.	0
1729	BUTTIGIEG	And we need to talk not only about the need for a president committed to ending endless war, but the fact that Congress has been asleep at the switch.	0
1730	BUTTIGIEG	And on my watch, I will propose that any authorization for the use of military force have a three-year sunset and have to be renewed, because if men and women in the military have the courage to go serve, members of Congress ought to have to summon the courage to vote on whether they ought to be there.	0
1731	TAPPER	Thank you, Mayor.	0
1732	TAPPER	Thank you, Mayor.	0
1733	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1734	TAPPER	I want to bring in Congressman O'Rourke.	0
1735	TAPPER	Congressman O'Rourke, responding -- returning, rather, to the question of whether you would withdraw all U.S. servicemembers from Afghanistan during your first year in office as president, how do you respond, sir?	0
1736	O'ROURKE	I would in my first term in office.	0
1737	O'ROURKE	Agree that there is nothing about perpetuating this war, already in its 18th year, that will make it any better.	0
1738	O'ROURKE	We've satisfied the reasons for our involvement in Afghanistan in the first place.	0
1739	O'ROURKE	And it's time to bring those servicemembers back home from Afghanistan, but also from Iraq, also from Yemen, and Somalia, and Libya, and Syria.	0
1740	O'ROURKE	There is no reason for us to be at war all over the world tonight.	0
1741	O'ROURKE	As president, I will end those wars, and we will not start new wars.	0
1742	O'ROURKE	We will not send more U.S. servicemembers overseas to sacrifice their lives and to take the lives of others in our name.	0
1743	O'ROURKE	We can resolve these challenges peacefully and diplomatically.	0
1744	TAPPER	Thank you, Congressman.	0
1745	TAPPER	Thank you, Congressman.	0
1746	TAPPER	Governor Hickenlooper, you disagree.	0
1747	TAPPER	You've said that you're open to keeping some servicemembers in Afghanistan beyond your first term.	0
1748	HICKENLOOPER	I look at it as a...	0
1749	TAPPER	Please respond.	0
1750	HICKENLOOPER	... humanitarian issue.	0
1751	HICKENLOOPER	And with all due respect, you're looking at the condition of women...	0
1752	WILLIAMSON	Thank you.	0
1753	HICKENLOOPER	... if we completely pull our troops out of there, you're going to see a humanitarian disaster that will startle and frighten every man, woman, and child in this country.	0
1754	HICKENLOOPER	And I don't think -- I mean, we have troops in over 400 different locations around the world.	0
1755	HICKENLOOPER	Most of them are small, they're peacekeeping, they're not greatly at risk.	0
1756	HICKENLOOPER	We’re going to have to be in Afghanistan.	0
1757	HICKENLOOPER	Look at the progress that’s happened in that country.	0
1758	HICKENLOOPER	We’re going to turn our backs and walk away from people that have risked their lives to help us and build a different future for Afghanistan and that part of the world?	0
1759	TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.	0
1760	TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.	0
1761	TAPPER	Senator Warren, you want to make it U.S. policy that the U.S. will never use a nuclear weapon unless another country uses one first.	0
1762	TAPPER	Now, President Obama reportedly considered that policy, but ultimately decided against it.	0
1763	TAPPER	Why should the U.S. tie its own hands with that policy?	0
1764	WARREN	Because it makes the world safer.	0
1765	WARREN	The United States is not going to use nuclear weapons preemptively, and we need to say so to the entire world.	0
1766	WARREN	It reduces the likelihood that someone miscalculates, someone misunderstands.	0
1767	WARREN	Our first responsibility is to keep ourselves safe.	0
1768	WARREN	And what's happening right now with Donald Trump is they keep expanding the different ways that we have nuclear weapons, the different ways that they could be used puts us all at risk.	0
1769	WARREN	You know, we talk about what’s happening around the world.	0
1770	WARREN	I have three older brothers who served in the military.	0
1771	WARREN	I see that they would do anything.	0
1772	WARREN	Our military is the best on Earth.	0
1773	WARREN	But we should not be asking our military to take on jobs that do not have a military solution.	0
1774	WARREN	We need to use our diplomatic tools, our economic tools, and if we’re going to send someone into war, we better have a plan for how we’re going to get them out on the other end.	0
1775	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.	0
1776	TAPPER	Governor Bullock, your response to Senator Warren's proposal to the U.S. never use a nuclear weapon first?	0
1777	BULLOCK	I wouldn't want to take that off the table.	0
1778	BULLOCK	I think America's strength -- we have to be able to say that.	0
1779	BULLOCK	Look, never, I hope, certainly in my term or anyone else, would we really even get close to pulling that trigger.	0
1780	BULLOCK	But by the same token, America's strength -- and, look, this president has made America first as America alone.	0
1781	BULLOCK	Our allies no longer trust us.	0
1782	BULLOCK	Our adversaries are with us.	0
1783	BULLOCK	But going from the position of strength, we should be negotiating down so there aren't nuclear weapons.	0
1784	BULLOCK	But drawing those lines in the sand, at this point I wouldn't do.	0
1785	LEMON	Thank you, Governor.	0
1786	LEMON	Senator Warren.	0
1787	LEMON	your response?	0
1788	WARREN	Look, we don't expand trust around the world by saying, "You know, we might be the first ones to use a nuclear weapon."	0
1789	WARREN	That puts the entire world at risk and puts us at risk, right in the middle of this.	0
1790	WARREN	At a time when Donald Trump is pulling out of our nuclear negotiations, expanding the opportunities for nuclear proliferation around the world, has pulled us out of the deal in Iran, and Iran is now working on its nuclear weapon, the world gets closer and closer to nuclear warfare.	0
1791	BULLOCK	Senator, that...	0
1792	WARREN	We have to have an announced policy that is one the entire world can live with.	0
1793	WARREN	We need to make that clear.	0
1794	WARREN	We will respond if someone else does, but not first.	0
1795	LEMON	Governor Bullock, please respond.	0
1796	BULLOCK	Part, I agree with.	0
1797	BULLOCK	But by the same token, like, we need to get back to nuclear proliferation.	0
1798	WARREN	Why?	0
1799	BULLOCK	But when you have folks -- de-proliferation, reducing it.	0
1800	BULLOCK	But at the same time, when you actually have Korea; when you have others, I don't want to turn around and say, "Well, Detroit has to be gone before we would ever use that."	0
1801	BULLOCK	When so many crazy folks are getting closer to having a nuclear weapon, I don't want them to think I could strike this country and I and we as the United States of America wouldn't do a thing.	0
1802	BULLOCK	Part of the strength really is the ability to deter.	0
1803	LEMON	Governor Bullock...	0
1804	WARREN	So...	0
1805	LEMON	Governor, thank you very much.	0
1806	LEMON	Moving on now...	0
1807	SANDERS	Could I add something to that...	0
1808	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1809	LEMON	Senator, please -- moving on now.	0
1810	LEMON	As you know, to serve as president of the United States -- all of you know this -- you have to be at least 35 years old.	0
1811	LEMON	So Mayor Buttigieg, you just qualified.	0
1812	LEMON	You're 37, the youngest candidate in this field.	0
1813	LEMON	Standing next to you is the oldest candidate, Bernie Sanders, at age 77.	0
1814	LEMON	Should voters take into consideration age when choosing a presidential candidate?	0
1815	BUTTIGIEG	I don't care how old you are.	0
1816	BUTTIGIEG	I care about your vision.	0
1817	BUTTIGIEG	But I do think it matters that we have a new generation of leaders stepping up around the world, leaders like the...	0
1818	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1819	BUTTIGIEG	I actually think it's good that the prime minister of New Zealand's gotten a lot of attention in Democratic debates.	0
1820	BUTTIGIEG	She's masterful.	0
1821	BUTTIGIEG	She is younger than I would be when I take office.	0
1822	BUTTIGIEG	This is the kind of trend America might be leading, instead of following, but only if it's actually backed by the right vision.	0
1823	BUTTIGIEG	And we can have great presidents at any age.	0
1824	BUTTIGIEG	What I will say is we need the kind of vision that's going to win.	0
1825	BUTTIGIEG	We cannot have a vision that amounts to back to normal.	0
1826	BUTTIGIEG	Because the only reason we got this president is that normal didn't work.	0
1827	BUTTIGIEG	We have to be ready to take on this president and, by the way, something that hasn't been talked about as much tonight, take on his enablers in Congress.	0
1828	BUTTIGIEG	You know, when...	0
1829	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1830	BUTTIGIEG	... when David Duke -- when David Duke ran for Congress -- ran for governor, the Republican Party, 20 years ago, ran away from him.	0
1831	BUTTIGIEG	Today they are supporting naked racism in the White House, or at best silent about it.	0
1832	BUTTIGIEG	And if you are watching this at home and you are a Republican member of Congress, consider the fact that, when the sun sets on your career and they are writing your story, of all the good and bad things you did in your life, the thing you will be remembered for is whether, in this moment, with this president, you found the courage to stand up to him or you continued to put party over country.	0
1833	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1834	LEMON	Thank you, Mayor.	0
1835	LEMON	Senator Sanders, as the senior statesman of the group, please respond to Mayor Buttigieg.	0
1836	SANDERS	Well, Pete is right.	0
1837	SANDERS	It's a question of vision.	0
1838	SANDERS	That's what it is, whether you're young, whether you're old, whether you're in between.	0
1839	SANDERS	And my vision, among other things, says that if we're going to fight for health care, we don't take money from the drug companies or the insurance companies.	0
1840	SANDERS	And I have asked all of the candidates who are running to say they will not accept money from those entities who, in my view, are going to war against the American people in terms of health care.	0
1841	SANDERS	That's a new vision.	0
1842	SANDERS	A new vision says that we must cancel completely student debt because the younger generation in this country today, for the first time in modern American history, will have a lower standard of living than their parents.	0
1843	LEMON	Thank you, Senator Sanders.	0
1844	WARREN	I'd like to respond on that, too.	0
1845	LEMON	The debate continues right after this -- please.	0
1846	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
1847	LEMON	Thank you.	0
1848	LEMON	The debate continues right after this short break.	0
1849	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
1850	TAPPER	Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debates.	0
1851	TAPPER	We have covered a lot of ground tonight.	0
1852	TAPPER	Now it is time for closing statements.	0
1853	TAPPER	You will each receive one minute.	0
1854	TAPPER	Governor Bullock, we're going to begin with you.	0
1855	BULLOCK	Thanks, Jake.	0
1856	BULLOCK	I was raised in a single-parent household, at times paycheck to paycheck.	0
1857	BULLOCK	Only knew there was a governor's house in town because I delivered newspapers to it, so I've made it about four blocks in life.	0
1858	BULLOCK	Worked my way through college, paid my way through law school.	0
1859	BULLOCK	But, you know, I had a chance to actually go from delivering newspapers to the governor's house as a kid to now raising our three kids in it.	0
1860	BULLOCK	We got to recognize for far too many people now in America that shot no longer exists.	0
1861	BULLOCK	And for far too many in this country, it never has.	0
1862	BULLOCK	I'm running for president to beat Donald Trump, win back the places we lost, and make sure that Americans know that where Washington has left them behind in the economy, in the political system, I'll be there.	0
1863	BULLOCK	This isn't a choice just between center and left or about -- we don't have to choose between what we don't want and what we can't afford.	0
1864	BULLOCK	Folks want a different way.	0
1865	BULLOCK	They want to believe the economy and our democracy can work for us.	0
1866	BULLOCK	That's why I'm running for president.	0
1867	TAPPER	Thank you.	0
1868	TAPPER	Ms. Williamson?	0
1869	WILLIAMSON	Yes, our problem is not just that we need to defeat Donald Trump.	0
1870	WILLIAMSON	We need a plan to solve institutionalized hatred, collectivized hatred, and white nationalism.	0
1871	WILLIAMSON	And in order to do that, we need more than political insider game and wonkiness and intellectual argument.	0
1872	WILLIAMSON	Those things will not defeat Donald Trump.	0
1873	WILLIAMSON	We need some radical truth-telling, not just to talk about health care, but talk about why are we so sick all the time.	0
1874	WILLIAMSON	We need to have a serious conversation about race and what is truly owed.	0
1875	WILLIAMSON	Even on the subject of foreign policy, it's all about symptoms and not about cause.	0
1876	WILLIAMSON	We need to talk about the fact that the United States has sacrificed our moral leadership.	0
1877	WILLIAMSON	The fact that countries see us, not only domestically but internationally, with policies that simply support our corporate overlords.	0
1878	WILLIAMSON	The fact that our national defense agenda is driven more by short-term profits for defense contractors than by genuine peace-building.	0
1879	WILLIAMSON	There's some corruption that is so deep, ladies and gentlemen.	0
1880	WILLIAMSON	And until the Democratic Party is ready to speak to the deeper corruption, knowing that we ourselves sometimes because of our own corporate donations have participated, than I'm afraid those who vote for Trump will continue to vote for Trump and those who might not like Donald Trump will continue to stay home.	0
1881	WILLIAMSON	I want a politics that goes much deeper.	0
1882	WILLIAMSON	I want a politics that speaks to the heart, because the only way to fight -- you keep talking about how we're going to fight Donald Trump.	0
1883	WILLIAMSON	You can't fight dog whistles.	0
1884	WILLIAMSON	You have to override them.	0
1885	WILLIAMSON	And the only way you can override them is with new voices, voices of energy that only come from the fact that America has been willing to live up to our own mistakes, atone for our mistakes, make amends for our own mistakes, love each other, love our democracy, love future generations, something emotional and psychological that will not be -- be emerging from anything on this stage.	0
1886	WILLIAMSON	It will emerge from something I'm the one who's qualified to bring forth.	0
1887	TAPPER	Congressman Delaney?	0
1888	DELANEY	Thank you, Jake.	0
1889	DELANEY	John F. Kennedy famously said we should not seek the Republican answer, we should not seek the Democratic answer, we should seek the right answer.	0
1890	DELANEY	He was right when he said it and he's right today, as well.	0
1891	DELANEY	Donald Trump is the symptom of a disease.	0
1892	DELANEY	And the disease is divisiveness.	0
1893	DELANEY	And I'm the only one on the stage talking about curing that disease, which -- with big ideas like national service, by focusing on actually solving problems.	0
1894	DELANEY	If we work together, we can fix health care and build infrastructure.	0
1895	DELANEY	We can invest in not just technology, but people and entrepreneurs, whether they be in Storm Lake, Iowa, or Detroit, Michigan, or Baltimore, Maryland.	0
1896	DELANEY	We can fight climate change and reimagine our education system.	0
1897	DELANEY	But we have to do it with real solutions, not impossible promises.	0
1898	DELANEY	Isn't it time we had a president who was a leader in both the private sector and in government, to lead us into the future?	0
1899	DELANEY	I promise, as president, I will restore vision, unity, and leadership, and decency to this country.	0
1900	DELANEY	And that's why I'm running for president.	0
1901	DELANEY	Thank you.	0
1902	TAPPER	Congressman Ryan?	0
1903	RYAN	So in a few minutes, all of the pundits are going to be looking at this debate and saying, well, who captured the left lane and who captured the center lane and who captured the moderate lane?	0
1904	RYAN	I hope tonight at some level I captured your imagination, your imagination about what this country could be like if we united, if we put together real policy that weren't left or right, but new and better.	0
1905	RYAN	That's how we win the future.	0
1906	RYAN	It's new and better.	0
1907	RYAN	A new and better economy, a new and better education system, a new and better health care system that focuses on prevention, an education system that focuses on the trauma of our kids.	0
1908	RYAN	There's not going to be a savior.	0
1909	RYAN	Not going to be a superstar that's going to fix all this.	0
1910	RYAN	It's going to be you and me.	0
1911	RYAN	It's going to be us.	0
1912	RYAN	That's how we fix this country, you and I coming together to do big things, to imagine the new country that we want by coming together, not left or right.	0
1913	RYAN	New and better.	0
1914	TAPPER	Governor Hickenlooper?	0
1915	HICKENLOOPER	Thank you.	0
1916	HICKENLOOPER	And what a night.	0
1917	HICKENLOOPER	I've loved it.	0
1918	HICKENLOOPER	I'd like to ask every American to imagine that you are facing life-threatening surgery tomorrow.	0
1919	HICKENLOOPER	Would you choose a doctor who had a track record of proven success, who'd actually done the work, or someone who had just talked about it?	0
1920	HICKENLOOPER	That's the question we're facing in this primary.	0
1921	HICKENLOOPER	I've actually got a track record as small-business owner, as a mayor, and as a governor.	0
1922	HICKENLOOPER	We expanded health care in Colorado.	0
1923	HICKENLOOPER	We got near universal coverage.	0
1924	HICKENLOOPER	We fought climate change directly.	0
1925	HICKENLOOPER	We beat the NRA.	0
1926	HICKENLOOPER	And for the last three years, we've been the number-one economy in the country.	0
1927	HICKENLOOPER	We can wrap all that out.	0
1928	HICKENLOOPER	I'm as progressive as anybody up on this stage, but I'm also pragmatic.	0
1929	HICKENLOOPER	And I've done the things that most of these other people are just talking about.	0
1930	HICKENLOOPER	And I know I can get results.	0
1931	HICKENLOOPER	And I can lead the people of this country towards a stronger, a healthier, and a more secure future, and defeat Donald Trump and return this country to its glory.	0
1932	HICKENLOOPER	Thank you.	0
1933	TAPPER	Senator Klobuchar?	0
1934	KLOBUCHAR	Well, thank you, Detroit.	0
1935	KLOBUCHAR	To win, we have to listen to people.	0
1936	KLOBUCHAR	And out there today is Casey Jo's mom.	0
1937	KLOBUCHAR	Casey Jo was a champion high school swimmer from a small town.	0
1938	KLOBUCHAR	She got sick, went to the emergency room, and got hooked on opioids.	0
1939	KLOBUCHAR	The last thing that she said to her mom was, "Mama, it's not my fault."	0
1940	KLOBUCHAR	And she died.	0
1941	KLOBUCHAR	A lot of Americans say the same thing every day.	0
1942	KLOBUCHAR	And that is what I will stand up for and what I will stand up against are companies like those pharma companies that got her hooked on those opioids and didn't tell the doctors or the patients what was going to happen.	0
1943	KLOBUCHAR	We need someone that has people's back.	0
1944	KLOBUCHAR	We also need someone that can win.	0
1945	KLOBUCHAR	And I have won in these red districts.	0
1946	KLOBUCHAR	I win in the Midwest.	0
1947	KLOBUCHAR	I can win in states like Wisconsin and Michigan and Iowa.	0
1948	KLOBUCHAR	I also will do my job without fear or favor, just like I did as a prosecutor, and get through the gridlock like I've done as a senator, where I've passed over 100 bills where I've been the lead Democrat.	0
1949	KLOBUCHAR	And last, yes, I will govern with integrity.	0
1950	KLOBUCHAR	We have a president where people turn off their TV when they see him.	0
1951	KLOBUCHAR	Not me.	0
1952	KLOBUCHAR	I will make you proud as your president.	0
1953	TAPPER	Congressman O'Rourke?	0
1954	O'ROURKE	We are as divided and polarized as a country as we have ever been.	0
1955	O'ROURKE	And right now we have a president who uses fear to try to drive us further apart.	0
1956	O'ROURKE	To meet this challenge, we have to have hope in one another and a faith in a future of the country that includes everyone.	0
1957	O'ROURKE	My whole life, I've been including people in the success of this country, starting a small business with high-value, high-wage, high-skilled jobs in the third poorest urban county in America, serving on City Council and holding town hall meetings every single week to remind myself who it is that I serve at the end of the day, and in Congress, being in the minority but working with Democrats and Republicans alike to deliver for my constituents and this country.	0
1958	O'ROURKE	And then in Texas, this last year, traveling to every county, not writing anybody off, not taking anyone for granted, and at the end of the day, winning more votes than any Democrat had in the history of the state, winning independents for the first time in decades, and winning nearly half-a-million Republicans, and those 38 Electoral College votes in Texas are now in play and I can win them.	0
1959	O'ROURKE	That is how we defeat Donald Trump in November of 2020 and how we bring this divided country together again in January of 2021.	0
1960	O'ROURKE	Thank you.	0

1973	But here's the good news	We can tell our kids that before we ran out of time, just before we ran out of time, in 2020, we did what it took to deliver a climate that we didn't have to wonder if it could support us, to deliver a society where race has no bearing on your health or your wealth or your relationship with law enforcement, that we did what it took to deliver an economy where a rising tide actually does lift all boats.	0
1974	But here's the good news	We can do this, if and only if we are ready to walk away from what hasn't worked with bold action and win, not only defeat this president, but defeat his congressional allies with a defeat so big that it reunites the Republican Party with its conscience as well as bringing Democrats to office.	0
